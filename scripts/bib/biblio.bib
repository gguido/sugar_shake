	abstract = {The most crucial stage in the dynamics of virus infections is the mode of virus transmission. In general, transmission of viruses can occur through two pathways: horizontal and vertical transmission. In horizontal transmission, viruses are transmitted among individuals of the same generation, while vertical transmission occurs from mothers to their offspring. Because of its highly organized social structure and crowded population density, the honey bee colony represents a risky environment for the spread of disease infection. Like other plant and animal viruses, bee viruses use different survival strategies, including utilization of both horizontal and vertical routes, to transmit and maintain levels in a host population. In this review, we explore the current knowledge about the honey bee viruses and transmission routes of bee viruses. In addition, different transmission strategies on the persistence and dynamics of host–pathogen interactions are also discussed.},

We demonstrated that the strain-specific 50\% lethal concentrations varied within an order of magnitude and that differences in amount of time for the pathogen to kill 100\% of the infected hosts {(LT100)} correlated with genotype. One genotype killed rather quickly, with a mean {LT100} of 7.8 ± 1.7 days postinfection, while the other genotypes acted more slowly, with mean {LT100s} of 11.2 ± 0.8 and 11.6 ± 0.6 days postinfection.},

Here we focus on individual defences, by presenting a genome-wide analysis of immunity in a social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera. We present honey bee models for each of four signalling pathways associated with immunity, identifying plausible orthologues for nearly all predicted pathway members. When compared to the sequenced Drosophila and Anopheles genomes, honey bees possess roughly one-third as many genes in 17 gene families implicated in insect immunity. We suggest that an implied reduction in immune flexibility in bees reflects either the strength of social barriers to disease, or a tendency for bees to be attacked by a limited set of highly coevolved pathogens.},

Among the individual traits, innate-immune responses have the potential to reduce both individual mortality and the spread of pathogens among colony members. An understanding of the costs and benefits of such responses can provide a more complete understanding of a primary risk of social life, horizontal disease transmission among colony members. Here we assess the impacts of individual immunity on colony-level disease in honey bee {(Apis} mellifera) colonies following exposure to an important bacterial pathogen {(Paenibacillus} larvae subsp. larvae, cause of the disease American foulbrood). Colony-level disease rates were negatively correlated with the immune responsiveness of colony members, as assessed by larval transcript levels for the gene encoding the antibacterial peptide abaecin. Concomitantly, colonies whose members mounted a stronger abaecin response showed significantly lower productivity, indicating a colony-level cost to this immune response. The results show considerable variation across colonies in an immune trait important for survival, and point toward a significant trade-off between this trait and colony productivity.},

	abstract = {Nosema ceranae and Nosema apis are two fungal pathogens belonging to the phylum Microsporidia and infecting the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. Recent studies have suggested that N. ceranae is more virulent than N. apis both at the individual insect level and at the colony level. Severe colony losses could be attributed to N. ceranae infections, and an unusual form of nosemosis is caused by this pathogen. In the present study, data from a 5-year cohort study of the prevalence of Nosema spp. in Germany, involving about 220 honeybee colonies and a total of 1,997 samples collected from these colonies each spring and autumn and analyzed via species-specific {PCR-restriction} fragment length polymorphism {(RFLP)}, are described. Statistical analysis of the data revealed no relation between colony mortality and detectable levels of infection with N. ceranae or N. apis. In addition, N. apis is still more prevalent than N. ceranae in the cohort of the German bee population that was analyzed. A possible explanation for these findings could be the marked decrease in spore germination that was observed after even a short exposure to low temperatures (+4 degrees C) for N. ceranae only. Reduced or inhibited N. ceranae spore germination at low temperatures should hamper the infectivity and spread of this pathogen in climatic regions characterized by a rather cold winter season.},

	abstract = {In recent years, honeybees {(Apis} mellifera) have been strangely disappearing from their hives, and strong colonies have suddenly become weak and died. The precise aetiology underlying the disappearance of the bees remains a mystery. However, during the same period, Nosema ceranae, a microsporidium of the Asian bee Apis cerana, seems to have colonized A. mellifera, and it's now frequently detected all over the world in both healthy and weak honeybee colonies. For first time, we show that natural N. ceranae infection can cause the sudden collapse of bee colonies, establishing a direct correlation between N. ceranae infection and the death of honeybee colonies under field conditions. Signs of colony weakness were not evident until the queen could no longer replace the loss of the infected bees. The long asymptomatic incubation period can explain the absence of evident symptoms prior to colony collapse. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that healthy colonies near to an infected one can also become infected, and that N. ceranae infection can be controlled with a specific antibiotic, fumagillin. Moreover, the administration of 120 mg of fumagillin has proven to eliminate the infection, but it cannot avoid reinfection after 6 months. We provide Koch's postulates between N. ceranae infection and a syndrome with a long incubation period involving continuous death of adult bees, non-stop brood rearing by the bees and colony loss in winter or early spring despite the presence of sufficient remaining pollen and honey.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is undergoing a worldwide decline whose origin is still in debate. Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. {METHODOLOGY/FINDING:} Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p.i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p.i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p.i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. {CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:} After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system. These data support the hypothesis that the combination of the increasing prevalence of N. ceranae with high pesticide content in beehives may contribute to colony depopulation.},

	abstract = {Managed honey bees are the most important commercial pollinators of those crops which depend on animal pollination for reproduction and which account for 35\% of the global food production. Hence, they are vital for an economic, sustainable agriculture and for food security. In addition, honey bees also pollinate a variety of wild flowers and, therefore, contribute to the biodiversity of many ecosystems. Honey and other hive products are, at least economically and ecologically rather, by-products of beekeeping. Due to this outstanding role of honey bees, severe and inexplicable honey bee colony losses, which have been reported recently to be steadily increasing, have attracted much attention and stimulated many research activities. Although the phenomenon "decline of honey bees" is far from being finally solved, consensus exists that pests and pathogens are the single most important cause of otherwise inexplicable colony losses. This review will focus on selected bee pathogens and parasites which have been demonstrated to be involved in colony losses in different regions of the world and which, therefore, are considered current threats to honey bees and beekeeping.},

Data from an initial study in which investigators compared pathogens in honey bees affected by {CCD} suggested a putative role for Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, {IAPV.} This is a single stranded {RNA} virus with no {DNA} stage placed taxonomically within the family Dicistroviridae. Although subsequent studies have failed to find {IAPV} in all {CCD} diagnosed colonies, {IAPV} has been shown to cause honey bee mortality. {RNA} interference technology {(RNAi)} has been used successfully to silence endogenous insect (including honey bee) genes both by injection and feeding. Moreover, {RNAi} was shown to prevent bees from succumbing to infection from {IAPV} under laboratory conditions. In the current study {IAPV} specific homologous {dsRNA} was used in the field, under natural beekeeping conditions in order to prevent mortality and improve the overall health of bees infected with {IAPV.} This controlled study included a total of 160 honey bee hives in two discrete climates, seasons and geographical locations {(Florida} and Pennsylvania). To our knowledge, this is the first successful large-scale real world use of {RNAi} for disease control.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Honey bees, Apis mellifera, face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. One route by which honey bees and other insects might combat disease is through the shielding effects of their microbial symbionts. Bees carry a diverse assemblage of bacteria, very few of which appear to be pathogenic. Here we explore the inhibitory effects of these resident bacteria against the primary bacterial pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae.


{RESULTS}

Here we isolate, culture, and describe by {16S} {rRNA} and protein-coding gene sequences 61 bacterial isolates from honey bee larvae, reflecting a total of 43 distinct bacterial taxa. We culture these bacteria alongside the primary larval pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae, and show that many of these isolates severely inhibit the growth of this pathogen. Accordingly, symbiotic bacteria including those described here are plausible natural antagonists toward this widespread pathogen.


{CONCLUSION}

The results suggest a tradeoff in social insect colonies between the maintenance of potentially beneficial bacterial symbionts and deterrence at the individual and colony level of pathogenic species. They also provide a novel mechanism for recently described social components behind disease resistance in insect colonies, and point toward a potential control strategy for an important bee disease.},

These viruses have a widespread prevalence in honey bee {(Apis} mellifera) colonies and a predominantly sub-clinical etiology that contrasts sharply with the extremely virulent pathology encountered at elevated titres, either artificially induced or encountered naturally. These viruses are frequently implicated in honey bee colony losses, especially when the colonies are infested with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Here we review the historical and recent literature of this virus complex, covering history and origins; the geographic, host and tissue distribution; pathology and transmission; genetics and variation; diagnostics, and discuss these within the context of the molecular and biological similarities and differences between the viruses. We also briefly discuss three recent developments relating specifically to {IAPV}, concerning its association with Colony Collapse Disorder, treatment of {IAPV} infection with {siRNA} and possible honey bee resistance to {IAPV.}},

	abstract = {* {1The} ecto-parasitic mite Varroa destructor is a serious world-wide pest of the honeybee Apis mellifera and has being linked with the death of millions of colonies, although its role in colony death has remained elusive.
* {2A} simulation model was developed to explain the link between the mite and collapse of the host bee colony, given that colony death does not always occur. We investigated the effects of two pathogens, deformed wing virus {(DWV)} and acute paralysis virus {(APV)}, vectored by the mite, on the host colony.
* {3Two} previously published simulation models, a bee and a mite, were combined and adapted for use in temperate climates with a variety of bee diseases. The model was constructed using Modelmaker® software, which allows the progression of a disease in the host colony to be followed daily.
* {4The} population dynamics generated by the model were similar to those observed in a natural honeybee colony. When {DWV-} or {APV-transmitting} mites were introduced into the colony, its adult worker bee population collapsed either during winter or spring for {DWV}, or autumn to spring for {APV.} This corresponds well with field observations of colony death in Europe.
* {5The} model revealed that {DWV} initially had little effect on the colony but during late summer, as the population of {DWV-transmitting} mites increased, the virus caused a reduction in the number of healthy young bees entering the overwintering population. This imbalance in the age structure of the overwintering bees resulted in the eventual death of the colony during the winter or spring. As few as 2000–3600 mites in autumn could kill a colony.
* {6In} contrast, {APV} transmitted by Varroa was only able to kill the honeybee colony if a large (10 000+) mite population was already present when an overt {APV} infection occurred. It was difficult for {APV} to become established within the bee population due to it causing rapid host death.
* {7The} model predicts that the less virulent {DWV} will become more widely established than the highly virulent {APV}, and that mite control measures need to be taken prior to the production of overwintering bees.},

	abstract = {Globalization has provided opportunities for parasites/pathogens to cross geographic boundaries and expand to new hosts. Recent studies showed that Nosema ceranae, originally considered a microsporidian parasite of Eastern honey bees, Apis cerana, is a disease agent of nosemosis in European honey bees, Apis mellifera, along with the resident species, Nosema apis. Further studies indicated that disease caused by N. ceranae in European honey bees is far more prevalent than that caused by N. apis. In order to gain more insight into the epidemiology of Nosema parasitism in honey bees, we conducted studies to investigate infection of Nosema in its original host, Eastern honey bees, using conventional {PCR} and duplex real time quantitative {PCR} methods. Our results showed that A. cerana was infected not only with N. ceranae as previously reported {[Fries}, I., Feng, F., Silva, {A.D.}, Slemenda, {S.B.}, Pieniazek, {N.J.}, 1996. Nosema ceranae n. sp. {(Microspora}, Nosematidae), morphological and molecular characterization of a microsporidian parasite of the Asian honey bee Apis cerana {(Hymenoptera}, Apidae). Eur. J. Protistol. 32, 356-365], but also with N. apis. Both microsporidia produced single and mixed infections. Overall and at each location alone, the prevalence of N. ceranae was higher than that of N. apis. In all cases of mixed infections, the number of N. ceranae gene copies (corresponding to the parasite load) significantly out numbered those of N. apis. Phylogenetic analysis based on a variable region of small subunit ribosomal {RNA} {(SSUrRNA)} showed four distinct clades of N. apis and five clades of N. ceranae and that geographical distance does not appear to influence the genetic diversity of Nosema populations. The results from this study demonstrated that duplex real-time {qPCR} assay developed in this study is a valuable tool for quantitative measurement of Nosema and can be used to monitor the progression of microsprodian infections of honey bees in a timely and cost efficient manner.},

	abstract = {The incidence of nosemosis has increased in recent years due to an emerging infestation of Nosema ceranae in managed honey bee populations in much of the world. A real-time {PCR} assay was developed to facilitate detection and quantification of both Nosema apis and N. ceranae in both single bee and pooled samples. The assay is a multiplexed reaction in which both species are detected and quantified in a single reaction. The assay is highly sensitive and can detect single copies of the target sequence. Real-time {PCR} results were calibrated to spore counts generated by standard microscopy procedures. The assay was used to assess bees from commercial apiaries sampled in November 2008 and March 2009. Bees from each colony were pooled. A large amount of variation among colonies was evident, signifying the need to examine large numbers of colonies. Due to sampling constraints, a subset of colonies (from five apiaries) was sampled in both seasons. In November, N. apis levels were 1212+/-148 spores/bee and N. ceranae levels were 51,073+/-31,155 spores/bee. In March, no N. apis was detected, N. ceranae levels were 11,824+/-6304 spores/bee. Changes in N. ceranae levels were evident among apiaries, some increasing and other decreasing. This demonstrates the need for thorough sampling of apiaries and the need for a rapid test for both detection and quantification of both Nosema spp. This assay provides the opportunity for detailed study of disease resistance, infection kinetics, and improvement of disease management practices for honey bees.},

Parasitism by the mite induced Asian worker bees to perform a series of cleaning behaviors that effectively removed the mites from the bodies of the adult host bees. The mites were subsequently killed and removed from the bee hives in a few seconds to a few minutes. The grooming behavior consists of self-cleaning, grooming dance, nestmate cleaning, and group cleaning. Worker bees can also rapidly and effectively remove the mites from the brood. The European bee showed cleaning behavior at low frequency and generally failed to remove the mites from both the adult bees and the brood.},

	title = {Analysis of Varroa destructor infestation of southern African honeybee populations},
	abstract = {The discovery of the honeybee-specific ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor in South Africa in October 1997 raised the spectre of massive honeybee colony losses as has occurred in most parts of the world where the varroa mite has been found. This was particularly concerning in Africa because of the importance of honeybees in the pollination of indigenous and commercial crops, and because of the numbers of small-scale beekeepers in Africa. The mite has now spread throughout South Africa and is found in almost all honeybee populations, both commercial and wild, and is also now present in most neighbouring countries. Varroa has not left a trail of destruction in South Africa as had been expected and no large scale collapse of the honeybee population occurred, despite the majority of beekeepers deciding not to protect their hives with chemical varroacides. Some colony losses did occur at the front of the varroa spread, and all colonies were found to be deleteriously affected by the mite which developed populations of 50 000 and more in some colonies. Infected colonies were also not as efficient as pollinators as uninfected colonies. Colonies exhibited all the same varroa effects witnessed in other parts of the world, with the exception that the majority of colonies did not die as a result of the infestation. The relative tolerance of African bees to the varroa mite has been confirmed by the long-term monitoring of both wild honeybee populations and commercial stock, and by population dynamic studies of the mites. In both wild and managed honeybee populations varroa appears to have been reduced to the status of an incidental pest. The development of mite tolerance took 3-5 years in the Cape honeybee {(Apis} mellifera capensis) and 6-7 years in the Savanna honeybee {(Apis} mellifera scutellata). The rapid development of mite tolerance in the Cape bee is thought to be due to the well developed removal of varroa-infested brood and the short post-capping period of worker brood. Together these resulted in a very rapid increase in infertile mites in the colony, the collapse of the mite population, and varroa tolerance. Tolerance does not develop as rapidly in Savanna honeybees as the post-capping period in these bees is similar to that of European bees and does not result in as many infertile mites. Nonetheless, varroa tolerance in Savanna bees develops more rapidly than would be the case in European bees because of more effective hygienic removal of varroa-infested brood. In both Cape and Savanna bees, the absence of varroacide applications and a “live-and-let-die” approach to the wild and commercial honeybee populations was crucial to the developed of population-wide varroa tolerance, in contrast to the selective breeding and pesticide treadmill practised in most parts of the world in an effort to get rid of the varroa mite. Varroa destructor is concluded not to be a serious threat to honeybees and beekeeping in Africa, and efforts should be made to prevent the use of pesticides and techniques that could hinder the development of natural mite tolerance in Africa.},

	abstract = {The parasitic mite Varroa destructor Anderson \& Trueman {(Acari:} Varroidae) is arguably the most detrimental pest of the European-derived honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Unfortunately, beekeepers lack a standardized sampling plan to make informed treatment decisions. Based on data from 31 commercial apiaries, we developed sampling plans for use by beekeepers and researchers to estimate the density of mites in individual colonies or whole apiaries. Beekeepers can estimate a colony's mite density with chosen level of precision by dislodging mites from approximately to 300 adult bees taken from one brood box frame in the colony, and they can extrapolate to mite density on a colony's adults and pupae combined by doubling the number of mites on adults. For sampling whole apiaries, beekeepers can repeat the process in each of n = 8 colonies, regardless of apiary size. Researchers desiring greater precision can estimate mite density in an individual colony by examining three, 300-bee sample units. Extrapolation to density on adults and pupae may require independent estimates of numbers of adults, of pupae, and of their respective mite densities. Researchers can estimate apiary-level mite density by taking one 300-bee sample unit per colony, but should do so from a variable number of colonies, depending on apiary size. These practical sampling plans will allow beekeepers and researchers to quantify mite infestation levels and enhance understanding and management of V. destructor.},

	abstract = {Reproduction and population growth of Varroa destructor was studied in ten naturally infested, Africanized honey bee {(AHB)} {(Apis} mellifera) colonies in Yucatan, Mexico. Between February 1997 and January 1998 monthly records of the amount of pollen, honey, sealed worker and drone brood were recorded. In addition, mite infestation levels of adult bees and worker brood and the fecundity of the mites reproducing in worker cells were determined. The mean number of sealed worker brood cells (10,070 +/- 1,790) remained fairly constant over the experimental period in each colony. However, the presence and amount of sealed drone brood was very variable. One colony had drone brood for 10 months and another for only 1 month. Both the mean infestation level of worker brood (18.1 +/- 8.4\%) and adult bees (3.5 +/- 1.3\%) remained fairly constant over the study period and did not increase rapidly as is normally observed in European honey bees. In fact, the estimated mean number of mites fell from 3,500 in February 1997 to 2,380 in January 1998. In May 2000 the mean mite population in the study colonies was still only 1,821 mites. The fertility level of mites in this study was much higher (83-96\%) than in {AHB} in Brazil (25-57\%). and similar to that found in {EHB} (76-94\%). Mite fertility remained high throughout the entire study and was not influenced by the amount of pollen, honey or worker brood in the colonies.},

Entombed pollen is sunken, capped cells amidst “normal”, uncapped cells of stored pollen, and some of the pollen contained within these cells is brick red in color. There appears to be a lack of microbial agents in the pollen, and larvae and adult bees do not have an increased rate of mortality when they are fed diets supplemented with entombed pollen in vitro, suggesting that the pollen itself is not directly responsible for increased colony mortality. However, the increased incidence of entombed pollen in reused wax comb suggests that there is a transmittable factor common to the phenomenon and colony mortality. In addition, there were elevated pesticide levels, notably of the fungicide chlorothalonil, in entombed pollen. Additional studies are needed to determine if there is a causal relationship between entombed pollen, chemical residues, and colony mortality.},

	abstract = {The honey bee colonies, with the relevant number of immature brood and adults, and stable, high levels of humidity and temperatures of their nests, result in suitable environments for the development of microorganisms including pathogens. In response, honey bees evolved several adaptations to face the increased risks of epidemic diseases. As the antimicrobial venom peptides of Apis mellifera are present both on the cuticle of adult bees and on the nest wax it has been recently suggested that these substances act as a social antiseptic device. Since the use of venom by honey bees in the context of social immunity needs to be more deeply investigated, we extended the study of this potential role of the venom to different species of the genus Apis {(A.} mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana and Apis andreniformis) using {MALDI-TOF} mass spectrometry techniques. In particular we investigated whether (similarly to A. mellifera) the venom is spread over the body cuticle and on the comb wax of these three Asian species. Our results confirm the idea that the venom functions are well beyond the classical stereotype of defence against predators, and suggest that the different nesting biology of these species may be related to the use of the venom in a social immunity context. The presence of antimicrobial peptides on the comb wax of the cavity-dwelling species and on the cuticle of workers of all the studied species represents a good example of “collective immunity” and a component of the “social immunity “ respectively.},

	abstract = {Transmission mechanisms of six honeybee viruses, including acute bee paralysis virus {(ABPV)}, black queen cell virus {(BQCV)}, chronic bee paralysis virus {(CBPV)}, deformed wing virus {(DWV)}, Kashmir bee virus {(KBV)}, and sacbrood bee virus {(SBV)}, in honey bee colonies were investigated by reverse transcription-{PCR} {(RT-PCR)} methods. The virus status of individual queens was evaluated by examining the presence of viruses in the queens' feces and tissues, including hemolymph, gut, ovaries, spermatheca, head, and eviscerated body. Except for head tissue, all five tissues as well as queen feces were found to be positive for virus infections. When queens in bee colonies were identified as positive for {BQCV}, {DWV}, {CBPV}, {KBV}, and {SBV}, the same viruses were detected in their offspring, including eggs, larvae, and adult workers. On the other hand, when queens were found positive for only two viruses, {BQCV} and {DWV}, only these two viruses were detected in their offspring. The presence of viruses in the tissue of ovaries and the detection of the same viruses in queens' eggs and young larvae suggest vertical transmission of viruses from queens to offspring. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of vertical transmission of viruses in honeybee colonies.},

	abstract = {Disposition of mirosamicin, a macrolide antibiotic, to honeybee adults, larvae, honey and royal jelly in the beehive after in-feed administration to adult bees was studied. Treatment was initiated at the end of July when the availability of natural pollen and nectar was poor. The drug was mixed with pollen-substitute paste and administered to honeybee colonies continuously for a week at a dossage of 200 mg/hive/week. High distributions in adult bees, jelly, larvae and a relatively low distribution in honey, of mirosamicin were observed. One day dosing of microsamin in sucrose syrup, a nectar substitute, resulted in a very high and long lasting residue in honey. Both royal and worker jelly, secreted from the jelly glands of adult bees, are acidic, so that a high distribution of a basic drug, such as mirosamicin, in jelly can be expected. This mechanism was considered to be responsible for a high concentration of mirosamicin in honeybee larvae, the host of Paenibacillus-larvae infection {(American} foulbrood), as primary larval food is jelly.},

	abstract = {The varroa mite, Varroa destructor Anderson \& Trueman, is a devastating pest of honey bees, Apis mellifera L., that has been primarily controlled over the last 15 yr with two in-hive miticides: the organophosphate coumaphos {(Checkmite+)}, and the pyrethroid tau-fluvalinate {(Apistan).} Both coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate are lipophilic compounds that are absorbed by the wax component of the hive, where they are stable and have the potential to build up over repeated treatments such that bees could be exposed to both compounds simultaneously. Although these compounds were chosen as in-hive miticides due to their low toxicity to honey bees, that low toxicity depends, at least in part, on rapid detoxification mediated by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes {(P450s).} In this laboratory study, we observed a large increase in the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate to 3-d-old bees that had been treated previously with coumaphos, and a moderate increase in the toxicity of coumpahos in bees treated previously with tau-fluvalinate. The observed synergism may result from competition between miticides for access to detoxicative P450s. These results suggest that honey bee mortality may occur with the application of otherwise sublethal doses of miticide when tau-fluvalinate and coumaphos are simultaneously present in the hive.},

	abstract = {A sensitive hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction {(PCR)} was used for detection of Melissococcus plutonius, the causative agent of European foulbrood {(EFB).} Sampling was made in Switzerland, where {EFB} is a widespread disease and incidences have increased in recent years. Larvae from brood samples with and without clinical signs of disease (n = 92) and honey (n = 92) from the same colonies were investigated. Individual larvae (n = 60) and pupae (n = 30) from diseased brood in single colonies were also investigated to study the distribution of the bacterium within the brood between larvae. M. plutonius was detected in larvae in all apiaries where symptoms of {EFB} could be seen, but not in all colonies judged as cases of {EFB} in the field, when healthy-looking larvae from such colonies were tested. The occurrence of the bacterium within the brood was not limited to larvae with symptoms only, but was mainly found in diseased larvae. The bacterium was also found in pupae. Healthy-looking larvae-even from heavily diseased combs-failed, in a number of cases, to amplify product in the {PCR.} M. plutonius could only be detected in 35\% of the brood nest honey from clinically diseased colonies.},

	abstract = {A polyphasic taxonomic study of four strains of Paenibacillus larvae and four strains of Paenibacillus pulvifaciens (including duplicates of both type strains) supported the reclassification of both former Bacillus species into one species, P. larvae. Our conclusions were based on morphological and Analytab Products {(API)} tests, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis {(SDS-PAGE)} of whole-cell proteins, gas chromatography of methylated fatty acids, pyrolysis mass spectrometry, {DNA-DNA} binding, and the following genomic fingerprinting methods: amplified ribosomal {DNA} restriction analysis, random amplified polymorphic {DNA} analysis, and {AFLP} analysis. The last method is a novel high-resolution {DNA} fingerprinting technique based on the selective amplification of restriction fragments. Despite more than 90\% {DNA} relatedness between the strains studied, {SDS-PAGE} of whole-cell proteins, biochemical tests, and {DNA} fingerprinting {(AFLP)} distinguished between the P. larvae and P. pulvifaciens strains at the subspecies level. Taking this evidence along with differences in pathogenicity, we propose to reclassify the honeybee pathogens P. larvae and P. pulvifaciens as P. larvae subsp. larvae and P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens. An emended description of the species and descriptions of the subspecies are given. The type strains are P. larvae subsp. larvae {ATCC} 9545 {(LMG} 9820) and P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens {NRRL} B-3685 {(LMG} 6911 and {ATCC} 13537).},

	abstract = {The ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, is the most destructive parasite of managed honeybee colonies worldwide. Since V. destructor transfers pathogens to honeybees, it may be adaptive for bees to respond to mite infestation by upregulating their immune responses. Mites, however, may overcome the host's immune responses by suppressing them, which could facilitate the mite's ability to feed on hemolymph. A humoral immune response of bees parasitized by V. destructor may be detected by studying the expression levels of antibacterial peptides, such as abaecin and defensin, known to be immune-responsive. Expression levels for these two antibacterial peptides changed non-linearly with respect to the number of mites parasitizing honeybee pupae. Bees exposed to low or moderate number of mites had fewer immune-related transcripts than pupae that were never parasitized or pupae with high mite loads. Although many of the pupae tested indicated the presence of bacteria, no correlation with mite numbers or immune-response levels existed. All bees tested negative for acute paralysis and Kashmir bee viruses known to be vectored by V. destructor.},

	abstract = {The recent decline in honey bee colonies observed in both European countries and worldwide is of great interest and concern, although the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In recent years, growing evidence has implicated parasites and pathogens in this decline of both the vitality and number of honey bee colonies. The Iberian Peninsula provides an interesting environment in which to study the occurrence of pathogens and parasites in the host honey bee populations due to the presence of two evolutionary lineages in A. m. iberiensis {(Western} European {[M]} or African {[A]).} Here, we provide the first evidence linking the population structure of the Iberian honey bee with the prevalence of some of its most important parasites and pathogens: the Varroa destructor mite and the microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. Using data collected in two surveys conducted in 2006 and 2010 in 41 Spanish provinces, the evolutionary lineage and the presence of the three parasitic organisms cited above were analyzed in a total of 228 colonies. In 2006 N. apis was found in a significantly higher proportion of M lineage honey bees than in the A lineage. However, in 2010 this situation had changed significantly due to a higher prevalence of N. ceranae. We observed no significant relationships in either year between the distributions of V. destructor or N. ceranae and the evolutionary lineage present in A. m. iberiensis colonies, but the effects of these organisms on the genetic diversity of the honey bee populations need further research.},

	abstract = {Microsporidiosis of adult honeybees caused by Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae is a common worldwide disease with negative impacts on colony strength and productivity. Few options are available to control the disease at present. The role of the queen in bee population renewal and the replacement of bee losses due to Nosema infection is vital to maintain colony homeostasis. Younger queens have a greater egg laying potential and they produce a greater proportion of uninfected newly eclosed bees to compensate for adult bee losses; hence, a field study was performed to determine the effect of induced queen replacement on Nosema infection in honey bee colonies, focusing on colony strength and honey production. In addition, the impact of long-term Nosema infection of a colony on the ovaries and ventriculus of the queen was evaluated. Queen replacement resulted in a remarkable decrease in the rates of Nosema infection, comparable with that induced by fumagillin treatment. However, detrimental effects on the overall colony state were observed due to the combined effects of stressors such as the queenless condition, lack of brood and high infection rates. The ovaries and ventriculi of queens in infected colonies revealed no signs of Nosema infection and there were no lesions in ovarioles or epithelial ventricular cells.},

	abstract = {Populations of honey bees and other pollinators have declined worldwide in recent years. A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used and highly toxic to honey bees, have been found in previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used {LC/MS-MS} to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season. These results have implications for a wide range of large-scale annual cropping systems that utilize neonicotinoid seed treatments.},

	abstract = {The Varroa mite, Varroa destructor, is recognized as the most serious pest of both managed and feral Western honey bee {(Apis} mellifera) in the world. The mite has developed resistance to fluvalinate, an acaricide used to control it in beehives, and fluvalinate residues have been found in the beeswax, necessitating an urgent need to find alternative control measures to suppress this pest. Accordingly, we investigated the possibility of using the fungus, Hirsutella thompsonii, as a biocontrol agent of the Varroa mite. Among the 9 isolates of H. thompsonii obtained from the University of Florida and the {USDA}, only the 3 {USDA} isolates {(ARSEF} 257, 1947 and 3323) were infectious to the Varroa mite in laboratory tests. The mite became infected when it was allowed to walk on a sporulating H. thompsonii culture for 5\&\#xa0;min. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that the membranous arolium of the mite leg sucker is the focus of infection where the fungal conidia adhered and germinated. The infected mites died from mycosis, with the lethal times to kill 50\% {(LT50s)} dependent on the fungal isolates. Thus, the {LT50s} were 52.7, 77.2, and 96.7\&\#xa0;h for isolates 3323, 257, and 1947, respectively. Passage of H. thompsonii through Varroa mite three times significantly reduced the {LT50s} of isolates 257 and 1947 {(P\&lt;0.05)} but not the {LT50} of isolate {3323.The} fungus did not infect the honey bee in larval, prepupal, pupal, and adult stages under our laboratory rearing conditions. Our encouraging results suggest that some isolates of H. thompsonii have the potential to be developed as a biocontrol agent for V. destructor. However, fungal infectivity against the mites under beehive conditions needs to be studied before any conclusion can be made.},

	abstract = {Honeybee hygienic behaviour provides colonies with protection from many pathogens and is an important model system of the genetics of a complex behaviour. It is a textbook example of complex behaviour under simple genetic control: hygienic behaviour consists of two components – uncapping a diseased brood cell, followed by removal of the contents – each of which are thought to be modulated independently by a few loci of medium to large effect. A worker’s genetic propensity to engage in hygienic tasks affects the intensity of the stimulus required before she initiates the behaviour. Genetic diversity within colonies leads to task specialization among workers, with a minority of workers performing the majority of nest-cleaning tasks. We identify three quantitative trait loci that influence the likelihood that workers will engage in hygienic behaviour and account for up to 30\% of the phenotypic variability in hygienic behaviour in our population. Furthermore, we identify two loci that influence the likelihood that a worker will perform uncapping behaviour only, and one locus that influences removal behaviour. We report the first candidate genes associated with engaging in hygienic behaviour, including four genes involved in olfaction, learning and social behaviour, and one gene involved in circadian locomotion. These candidates will allow molecular characterization of this distinctive behavioural mode of disease resistance, as well as providing the opportunity for marker-assisted selection for this commercially significant trait.},

Parasites and pathogens are considered as principal actors, in particular the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, associated viruses and the microsporidian Nosema ceranae. Here we used long term monitoring of colonies and screening for eleven disease agents and genes involved in bee immunity and physiology to identify predictive markers of honeybee colony losses during winter. The data show that {DWV}, Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor and Vitellogenin can be predictive markers for winter colony losses, but their predictive power strongly depends on the season.

	abstract = {In agriculture, honey bees play a critical role as commercial pollinators of crop monocultures which depend on insect pollination. Hence, the demise of honey bee colonies in Europe, {USA}, and Asia caused much concern and initiated many studies and research programmes aiming at elucidating the factors negatively affecting honey bee health and survival. Most of these studies look at individual factors related to colony losses. In contrast, we here present our data on the interaction of pathogens and parasites in honey bee colonies. We performed a longitudinal cohort study over 6 years by closely monitoring 220 honey bee colonies kept in 22 apiaries (ten randomly selected colonies per apiary). Observed winter colony losses varied between 4.8\% and 22.4\%; lost colonies were replaced to ensure a constant number of monitored colonies over the study period. Data on mite infestation levels, infection with viruses, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, and recorded outbreaks of chalkbrood were continuously collected. We now provide statistical evidence (i) that Varroa destructor infestation in summer is related to {DWV} infections in autumn, (ii) that V. destructor infestation in autumn is related to N. apis infection in the following spring, and most importantly (iii) that chalkbrood outbreaks in summer are related to N. ceranae infection in the preceding spring and to V. destructor infestation in the same season. These highly significant links between emerging parasites/pathogens and established pathogens need further experimental proof but they already illustrate the complexity of the host–pathogen-interactions in honey bee colonies.},

	abstract = {Conflict is rare among the members of a highly cooperative society such as a honey bee colony. However, conflict within a colony increases drastically during colony reproduction (‘swarming’) when newly produced queens fight each other until only one queen remains in the nest. This study describes the behavior of queens and workers during naturally occurring queen combat. The duels of five pairs of queens were observed in three observation colonies. A typical duel is described qualitatively and the events of all five duels are described quantitatively. Several aspects of duels that are of particular interest are examined in detail, including the behavior of queens near capped queen cells, worker aggression toward queens, queen tooting, and the relation of queen and worker behavior to the outcome of the duel. The results of this investigation serve as a foundation for rigorous tests of hypotheses regarding the adaptive significance of queen and worker behavior during queen combat. The results presented suggest that: young queens patrol queen cells to kill rival queens while they are vulnerable; workers aggress queens to prevent them from destroying queen cells; queens toot to inhibit worker aggression; workers immobilize queens to make them easy targets for rival queens; and queens eject hind-gut contents to cause their rival to be immobilized by the workers.},

	abstract = {Two experiments were performed to determine whether worker reproduction in queenless honey bee colonies is influenced by colony genetic structure. In Experiment 1, allozyme analyses of workers and worker-derived drone larvae revealed that in half the colonies, there were genotypic differences in worker egg-laying behavior (presumed to involve actual oviposition), but biases in drone production were not always consistent with biases in egg-laying behavior. In Experiment 2, allozyme analyses again revealed intracolonial differences in egg-laying behavior and in behavior patterns thought to involve oophagy and larval care. Data support the hypothesis of a genetic influence on this intracolonial behavioral variation. Differences in the genotypic distributions of worker-derived drones relative to workers engaged in oviposition behavior in queenless colonies may be a consequence of genetic variability for egg production or for treatment of eggs and larvae (possibly coupled with kin recognition), or both.},

The capacity of bee pollen as a substrate for production of ochratoxin A {(OTA)} by a strain of Aspergillus ochraceus was studied. For control purposes corn, wheat and rice grains, and eleven liquid media were assayed. They were Yeast Extract Sucrose broth {(YES)}, {YES} supplemented with 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5\% bee pollen, {YES} supplemented with 0.5\% peptone, 50\% must, Wickerham medium, Aflatoxin Production medium and Coconut Broth Medium. Cultures were maintained at 28 C for 4 weeks and were analyzed every seven days for {OTA} by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. {OTA} production in bee pollen was significantly {(P} \&lt; 0.01) higher than production in corn, wheat and rice grains regardless of incubation time. With regard to liquid cultures, {OTA} accumulation in {YES} supplemented with 5\% bee pollen was significantly higher than in pollen-free liquid cultures. A positive correlation between the proportion of pollen added to {YES} medium and {OTA} level was observed. This is the first report concerning the use of bee pollen as a substrate to stimulate {OTA} production. On the basis of the preliminary results obtained in this study it can be hypothesized that bee pollen may constitute an important risk factor concerning the presence of {OTA} in the diet of consumers of that nutritious food.},

The botanical origin of the pollen pellets was obtained using microscopic pollen identification of color-dependent subsamples. The results obtained had an average of 7.4\% moisture, 20\% proteins, 6\% lipids, 2.2\% ash, absence of vitamin C and beta-carotene and presence of total carotenoids. The color of the pollen pellets was not determinant for taxa identification due to the fact that most of the pellets named as monofloral samples presented two or more botanical taxa. The most frequent plant families from a total of 17 taxa identified were Arecaceae, Asteraceae and Myrtaceae. In conclusion, due to the intraspecific differences in compounds from the taxa collected, the data obtained using chemical and microscopic analysis can play an important role in the quality control of dry bee pollen pellets if the samples are mostly monofloral.},

A total of 90 ready-to-eat bee pollen samples were analyzed. Eighty-seven samples were collected in stores placed in different Spanish areas and three were from Buenos Aires {(Argentina).} The statistical results {(ANOVA)} showed that yeasts and Penicillium spp. were the predominant fungi. With regard to the potential mycotoxin producing species, Penicillium verrucosum, Aspergillus niger aggregate, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus and Alternaria spp. were found. The last genus was isolated very frequently. The potential ability for producing ochratoxin A {(OTA)} and aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 was studied by culturing in vitro the isolates followed by analysis of these mycotoxins in culture extracts by {HPLC} with fluorescent detection. It was found that 100\%, 53.3\%, 33.3\% and 25\% of the isolates of A. carbonarius, A. ochraceus, P. verrucosum and A. niger aggregate, respectively, produced {OTA.} Moreover, 28.6\% of the isolates from the A. flavus plus A. parasiticus group were able to produce aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxin B2 was detected in only 10\% of the cultures. Aflatoxins G1 and G2 were not detected in cultures under the assayed conditions. This is the first report carried out on the natural mycobiota occurring in bee pollen in general and on the toxigenic capability of these isolates in particular.},

Upon emergence drones have significantly larger amounts per unit weight when emerging, than workers; perhaps as adaption to the risk of not being fed as intensely as young workers. Maximum content was 0.23\&\#xa0;mg for workers (28\&\#xa0;d), and 0.59\&\#xa0;mg for drones (after emergence). Workers have relatively constant glycogen contents during their life, and very young drones have more glycogen than older ones. Young queens are similar to workers. In workers and queens in summer the greatest amounts of glycogen are found in the thorax. When the bees start flying (6th–8th day of life), drones have the highest amounts in the head (probably to supply their eyes), and upon maturity, drones have the least glycogen in the abdomen.

Workers in winter show different glycogen values depending on whether they are active bees from the core area (0.23\&\#xa0;mg) or inactive ones from the outer surface of the winter cluster (0.37\&\#xa0;mg). They use glycogen from the thorax and the abdomen for their ongoing energy need.},

	abstract = {The worldwide decline in honeybee colonies during the past 50 years has often been linked to the spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses. Recently in the United States, dramatic honeybee losses (colony collapse disorder) have been reported; however, there remains no clear explanation for these colony losses, with parasitic mites, viruses, bacteria, and fungal diseases all being proposed as possible candidates. Common characteristics that most failing colonies share is a lack of overt disease symptoms and the disappearance of workers from what appears to be normally functioning colonies. In this study, we used quantitative {PCR} to monitor the presence of three honeybee viruses, deformed wing virus {(DWV)}, acute bee paralysis virus {(ABPV)}, and black queen cell virus {(BQCV)}, during a 1-year period in 15 asymptomatic, varroa mite-positive honeybee colonies in Southern England, and 3 asymptomatic colonies confirmed to be varroa mite free. All colonies with varroa mites underwent control treatments to ensure that mite populations remained low throughout the study. Despite this, multiple virus infections were detected, yet a significant correlation was observed only between {DWV} viral load and overwintering colony losses. The long-held view has been that {DWV} is relatively harmless to the overall health status of honeybee colonies unless it is in association with severe varroa mite infestations. Our findings suggest that {DWV} can potentially act independently of varroa mites to bring about colony losses. Therefore, {DWV} may be a major factor in overwintering colony losses.},

In the present study, we used a modeling approach of survival data of caged bees under chronic exposure to two pesticides (imidacloprid and deltamethrin). Our model, based on a Cox proportional hazard model, is not restricted to a specific hazard functional form, such as in parametric approaches, but takes into account multiple covariates. We consider not only the pesticide treatment but also a nuisance variable (variability between replicates). Moreover, considering the occurrence of social interactions, the model integrates the fact that bees do not die independently of each other. We demonstrate the chronic toxicity induced by imidacloprid and deltamethrin. Our results also underline the role of the replicate effect, the density-dependent effect, and their interactions with the treatment effect. None of these parameters can be neglected in the assessment of chronic toxicity of pesticides to the honeybee.},

Some compounds in the blend have specialized functions. Benzyl acetate released only flight behavior, whereas three compounds (1-butanol, 1-octanol, and hexyl acetate) caused only the recruitment response. Other compounds (1-hexanol, butyl acetate, iso-pentyl acetate, and 2-nonanol) acted in more than one behavioral context. Octyl acetate was the most effective compound in allowing bees to locate targets, but did not recruit or release flight behavior. Stationary octyl acetate sources were located by flying bees, indicating that this pheromone component elicits a chemotactic response. However, localization of a target is due primarily to the motion of the target; the alarm pheromone components release searching behavior for a moving object and are relatively unimportant in target localization.},

	abstract = {Imidaclopridi a systemic nitroguanidine insecticide that belongs to theneonicotinoid family. As an agonist of the acetylcholine receptor, it attacks the insect nervous system and is extremely effective against various sucking and mining pests. Oral acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid and its main metabolites (5-hydroxyimidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, desnitroimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, olefin, and urea derivative) were investigated in Apis mellifera. Acute intoxication by imidacloprid or its metabolites resulted in the rapid appearance of neurotoxicity symptoms, such as hyperresponsiveness, hyperactivity, and trembling and led to hyporesponsiveness and hypoactivity. For acute toxicity tests, bees were treated with doses of toxic compounds ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/bee (10–10,000 μg/kg). Acute toxicity {(LD50)} values of imidacloprid were about 60 ng/bee (600 μg/kg) at 48 h and about 40 ng/bee (400 μg/kg) at 72 and 96 h. Out of the six imidacloprid metabolites tested, only two (5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin) exhibited a toxicity close to that of imidacloprid. Olefin {LD50} values were lower than those of imidacloprid. The 5-hydroxyimidacloprid showed a lower toxicity than imidacloprid with a {LD50} four to six times higher than that of imidacloprid. Urea also appeared as a compound of nonnegligible toxicity by eliciting close to 40\% mortality at 1,000 ng/bee (10,000 μg/kg). However, no significant toxicity was observed with 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and desnitroimidacloprid in the range of doses tested. To test chronic toxicity, worker bees were fed sucrose solutions containing 0.1, 1, and 10 {μg/L} of imidacloprid and its metabolites for 10 d. Fifty percent mortality was reached at approximately 8 d. Hence, considering that sucrose syrup was consumed at the mean rate of 12 μl/d and per bee, after an 8-d period the cumulated doses were approximately 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/bee (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/kg). Thus, all tested compounds were toxic at doses 30 to 3,000 (olefin), 60 to 6,000 (imidacloprid), 200 to 20,000 (5-{OH-imidacloprid)}, and {\textgreater}1,000 to 100,000 (remaining metabolites) times lower than those required to produce the same effect in acute intoxication studies. For all products tested, bee mortality was induced only 72 h after the onset of intoxication.},

In untreated honeybees, the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex is age-dependent and there is a significant increase in the number of trials required for habituation in older bees (8–10 days old) as compared to very young bees (4–7 days old). Imidacloprid alters the number of trials needed to habituate the honeybee response to multiple sucrose stimulation. In 7-day-old bees, treatment with Imidacloprid leads to an increase in the number of trials necessary to abolish the response, whereas in 8-day-old bees, it leads to a reduction in the number of trials for habituation (15 min and 1 h after treatment), and to an increase 4 h after treatment. The temporal effects of Imidacloprid in both 7- and 8-day-old bees suggest that 4h after treatment the observed effects are due to a metabolite of Imidacloprid, rather than to Imidacloprid itself. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of nicotinic receptors in the honeybee that have different affinities to Imidacloprid and are differentially expressed in 7- and 8-day-old individuals.},

Imidacloprid, a strong systemic compound, is effective against several sucking and mining pests. The acute toxicity of contact and oral applications on two Apis mellifera subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera caucasica, was investigated. In all toxicological studies, each dose included three cages of 20 individuals and each study was replicated three times. The dose-mortality relation revealed some unusual characteristics. At low imidacloprid concentrations, a biphasic mortality appeared, particularly with the contact exposure route. At moderate doses, mortality profiles at 24 and 48 h were different only after oral application. Response kinetics showed that mortality was delayed at the higher doses of imidacloprid. After oral intoxication, the {LD50} values of imidacloprid at 24 and 48 h were about 5 ng/bee for both A. m. mellifera and A. m. caucasica. After contact application, the {LD50} values at 24 and 48 h were approximately 24 ng/bee for A. m. mellifera and 14 ng/bee for A. m. caucasica.

	abstract = {Habituation of the proboscis extension reflex {(PER)} in honeybees {(Apis} mellifera) is age-dependent. Very young bees (≤7 days old) require significantly less trials to abolish the response to multiple sucrose stimulations than older bees (≥8 days old). A nicotinic agonist, imidacloprid, modifies this behaviour by increasing the number of trials in ≤7-day-old bees and by decreasing it in older bees {[Neurobiol.} Learn. Mem. 76 (2001) 183.]. Here we tested our hypothesis that this effect is associated with a differential expression of two subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {(nAChRs).} By testing the effects of six metabolites of imidacloprid, we show that two of them, olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, modify the number of trials needed to habituate the {PER} in a contrasting manner. Olefin increases the number of trials in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid decreases the number of trials, but only in 8-day-old individuals. We conclude that olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid are specific agonists of two subtypes of an {nAChR} that are differentially expressed during adult maturation of young honeybees. Olefin is the agonist of an {nAChR} expressed in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid is the agonist of a late-onset {nAChR} that is activated in 8-day-old bees. The implications of this finding for the honeybee biology are discussed.},

Joined actions of deltamethrin (pyrethroid) and pirimicarb (carbamate), alone or in association, are investigated on {AChE} activity in surviving and dead honeybees, with a special focus on the relative proportions of its membrane and soluble forms. At the {0.5X} dose (12.5\&\#xa0;ng of deltamethrin and/or 2.5\&\#xa0;μg of pirimicarb per bee), the residual tissue {AChE} activity in dead bees was 78\% with deltamethrin, 43\% with pirimicarb and 33\% with dual treatment. In surviving bees, tissue {AChE} activity represented 250\%, and 270\% of control {AChE} activity with deltamethrin and dual treatment, respectively. The analysis of membrane and soluble {AChE} forms revealed an increase in the soluble form in dead bees after deltamethrin and dual treatment. However, in vitro investigations showed no direct interaction of deltamethrin on soluble and membrane {AChE} activity. The results suggest that the action of deltamethrin on {AChE} activity, in honeybee intact organisms, could be due to indirect mechanisms. The duality of {AChE} response to deltamethrin exposure, exhibited by the possibility of increase (surviving bees) or decrease (dead bees) of its activity has been pointed out for the first time. The important increase in {AChE} activity in response to deltamethrin, not altered by pirimicarb treatment, suggests that {AChE} activity could represent a robust biomarker specific to deltamethrin exposure in living bees.},

The latter showed a 48-h oral {LD50} value (153 ng per bee) five times higher than that of imidacloprid (30 ng per bee). Chronic feeding tests indicated that the lowest observed effect concentrations {(LOEC)} of imidacloprid and of 5-{OH-imidacloprid} on mortality of winter bees were 24 and 120 µg kg−1 respectively. Behavioural effects of imidacloprid and 5-{OH-imidacloprid} were studied using the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension response at two periods of the year. Winter bees surviving chronic treatment with imidacloprid and 5-{OH-imidacloprid} had reduced learning performances. The {LOEC} of imidacloprid was lower in summer bees (12 µg kg−1) than in winter bees (48 µg kg−1), which points to a greater sensitivity of honeybees behaviour in summer bees, compared to winter bees.

	abstract = {Although overall pollinator populations have declined over the last couple of decades, the honey bee {(Apis} mellifera) malady, colony collapse disorder {(CCD)}, has caused major concern in the agricultural community. Among honey bee pathogens, {RNA} viruses are emerging as a serious threat and are suspected as major contributors to {CCD.} Recent detection of these viral species in bumble bees suggests a possible wider environmental spread of these viruses with potential broader impact. It is therefore vital to study the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in the hymenopteran pollinator community as a whole. We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-{PCR} and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like {RNA} viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in pollen pellets collected directly from forager bees. Pollen pellets from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus-contaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by {CCD} harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus {(IAPV)}, nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had {IAPV}, while those near apiaries without {IAPV} did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, {IAPV} moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general.},

Food scouts showed extensive differences in brain gene expression relative to other foragers, including differences related to catecholamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid signaling. Octopamine and glutamate treatments increased the likelihood of scouting, whereas dopamine antagonist treatment decreased it. These findings demonstrate intriguing similarities in human and insect novelty seeking and suggest that this trait, which presumably evolved independently in these two lineages, may be subserved by conserved molecular components.},

Although many species are known to provide pollination services, honeybees {(Apis} mellifera) are often assumed to provide the majority of these services to agriculture. Using data from a range of secondary sources, this study assesses the importance of insect pollinated crops at regional and national scales and investigates the capacity of honeybees to provide optimal pollination services to {UK} agriculture. The findings indicate that insect pollinated crops have become increasingly important in {UK} crop agriculture and, as of 2007, accounted for 20\% of {UK} cropland and 19\% of total farmgate crop value. Analysis of honeybee hive numbers indicates that current {UK} populations are only capable of supplying 34\% of pollination service demands even under favourable assumptions, falling from 70\% in 1984. In spite of this decline, insect pollinated crop yields have risen by an average of 54\% since 1984, casting doubt on long held beliefs that honeybees provide the majority of pollination services. Future land use and crop production patterns may further increase the role of pollination services to {UK} agriculture, highlighting the importance of measures aimed at maintaining both wild and managed species.},

	abstract = {1. Wild bees are one of the most important groups of pollinators in the temperate zone. Therefore, population declines have potentially negative impacts for both crop and wildflower pollination. Although heavy metal pollution is recognized to be a problem affecting large parts of the European Union, we currently lack insights into the effects of heavy metals on wild bees.
2. We investigated whether heavy metal pollution is a potential threat to wild bee communities by comparing (i) species number, (ii) diversity and (iii) abundance as well as (iv) natural mortality of emerging bees along two independent gradients of heavy metal pollution, one at Olkusz {(OLK)}, Poland and the other at Avonmouth {(AVO)}, {UK.} We used standardized nesting traps to measure species richness and abundance of wild bees, and we recorded the heavy metal concentration in pollen collected by the red mason bee Osmia rufa as a measure of pollution.
3. The concentration of cadmium, lead and zinc in pollen collected by bees ranged from a background level in unpolluted sites {[OLK:} 1·3, 43·4, 99·8 (mg kg−1); {AVO:} 0·8, 42·0, 56·0 (mg kg−1), respectively] to a high level on sites in the vicinity of the {OLK} and {AVO} smelters {[OLK:} 6·7, 277·0, 440·1 (mg kg−1); {AVO:} 9·3, 356·2, 592·4 (mg kg−1), respectively].
4. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration, there was a steady decrease in the number, diversity and abundance of solitary, wild bees. In the most polluted sites, traps were empty or contained single occupants, whereas in unpolluted sites, the nesting traps collected from 4 to 5 species represented by up to ten individuals. Moreover, the proportion of dead individuals of the solitary bee Megachile ligniseca increased along the heavy metal pollution gradient at {OLK} from 0·2 in uncontaminated sites to 0·5 in sites with a high concentration of pollution.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the negative relationship between heavy metal pollution and populations of wild bees and suggest that increasing wild bee richness in highly contaminated areas will require special conservation strategies. These may include creating suitable nesting sites and sowing a mixture of flowering plants as well as installing artificial nests with wild bee cocoons in polluted areas. Applying protection plans to wild pollinating bee communities in heavy metal-contaminated areas will contribute to integrated land rehabilitation to minimize the impact of pollution on the environment.},

	abstract = {The Israeli acute paralysis virus {(IAPV)} is a significant marker of honeybee colony collapse disorder {(CCD).} In the present work, we provide the first evidence that Varroa destructor is {IAPV} replication-competent and capable of vectoring {IAPV} in honeybees. The honeybees became infected with {IAPV} after exposure to Varroa mites that carried the virus. The copy number of {IAPV} in bees was positively correlated with the density of Varroa mites and time period of exposure to Varroa mites. Further, we showed that the mite–virus association could possibly reduce host immunity and therefore promote elevated levels of virus replication. This study defines an active role of Varroa mites in {IAPV} transmission and sheds light on the epidemiology of {IAPV} infection in honeybees.},

Honey bees {(Apis} mellifera) are classified as food-producing animals but, to date, veterinary surgeons have played only a very modest role within the apiculture industry in the {UK.} However, the future of honey bee colonies will depend on practitioners working together with beekeepers to limit further losses. This article describes the most important pathogens affecting honey bees and outlines the options for treatment.

While recent surveys reported that parasite-insecticide interactions can synergistically and negatively affect honeybee survival, the importance of sequence in exposure to stressors has hardly received any attention. In this work, Western honeybees {(Apis} mellifera) were sequentially or simultaneously infected by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae and chronically exposed to a sublethal dose of the insecticide fipronil, respectively chosen as biological and chemical stressors. Interestingly, every combination tested led to a synergistic effect on honeybee survival, with the most significant impacts when stressors were applied at the emergence of honeybees. Our study presents significant outcomes on beekeeping management but also points out the potential risks incurred by any living organism frequently exposed to both pathogens and insecticides in their habitat.},

	abstract = {Drones are haploid male individuals whose major social function in honey bee colonies is to produce sperm and mate with a queen. In spite of their limited tasks, the vitality of drones is of utmost importance for the next generation. The immune competence of drones – as compared to worker bees – is largely unexplored. Hence, we studied humoral and cellular immune reactions of in vitro reared drone larvae and adult drones of different age upon artificial bacterial infection. Haemolymph samples were collected after aseptic and septic injury and subsequently employed for (1) the identification of immune-responsive peptides and/or proteins by qualitative proteomic analyses in combination with mass spectrometry and (2) the detection of antimicrobial activity by inhibition-zone assays. Drone larvae and adult drones responded with a strong humoral immune reaction upon bacterial challenge, as validated by the expression of small antimicrobial peptides. Young adult drones exhibited a broader spectrum of defence reactions than drone larvae. Distinct polypeptides including peptidoglycan recognition protein-S2 and lysozyme 2 were upregulated in immunized adult drones. Moreover, a pronounced nodulation reaction was observed in young drones upon bacterial challenge. Prophenoloxidase zymogen is present at an almost constant level in non-infected adult drones throughout the entire lifespan. All observed immune reactions in drones were expressed in the absence of significant amounts of vitellogenin. We conclude that drones – like worker bees – have the potential to activate multiple elements of the innate immune response.},

Ambient temperatures during the treatment period were in the lower half of the range recommended on the label, but were typical for early fall in upstate New York. Average mite mortality was 60.2 ± 2.2\% in the Mite-Away {II} group and 23.3 ± 2.6\% in the untreated control group. These means were significantly different from each other, but the level of control was only moderate. These results demonstrate that Mite-Away {II} may not always provide an adequate level of control even when the temperature at the time of application falls within the recommended range stated on the product’s label. To make the best use of temperature-sensitive products, I suggest that the current, single-value, economic treatment threshold be replaced with an economic treatment range. The limits for this range are specified by two pest density values. The lower limit is the usual pest density that triggers a treatment. The upper limit is the maximum pest density that one can expect to reduce to a level below the lower limit given the temperatures expected during the treatment period. When the actual pest density exceeds the upper limit, the product should not be recommended; or, a warning should be included indicating that acceptable control may not be achieved.},

Forty-eight varroa-infested colonies were randomly distributed amongst six experimental groups (n = 8 colonies per group): one control group {(G1);} two groups tested applications of different dosages of a 40 g {OA/l} sugar solution 1:1 trickled on bees {(G2} and G3); three groups tested different applications of {FA:} 35 ml of 65\% {FA} in an absorbent Dri-Loc ® pad {(G4);} 35 ml of 65\% {FA} poured directly on the hive bottom board {(G5)} and {MiteAwayII™} {(G6).} The efficacy of treatments (varroa drop), colony development, honey yield and hive survival were monitored from May until September. Five honey bee queens died during this research, all of which were in the {FA} treated colonies {(G4}, G5 and G6). G6 colonies had significantly lower brood build-up during the beekeeping season. Brood populations at the end of summer were significantly higher in G2 colonies. Spring honey yield per colony was significantly lower in G6 and higher in G1. Summer honey flow was significantly lower in G6 and higher in G3 and G5. During the treatment period, there was an increase of mite drop in all the treated colonies. Varroa daily drop at the end of the beekeeping season {(September)} was significantly higher in G1 and significantly lower in G6. The average number of dead bees found in front of hives during treatment was significantly lower in G1, G2 and G3 versus G4, G5 and G6. Results suggest that varroa control is obtained from all spring treatment options. However, all groups treated with {FA} showed slower summer hive population build-up resulting in reduced honey flow and weaker hives at the end of summer. {FA} had an immediate toxic effect on bees that resulted in queen death in five colonies. The {OA} treatments that were tested have minimal toxic impacts on the honey bee colonies.},

At the end of the 42-day period of the experiment in Texas, the number of mites per bee was reduced by 69-fold in bee hives treated with Apistan and 25-fold in hives treated with the fungus; however mite infestations increased by 1.3-fold in the control bee hives. Similarly, the number of mites in sealed brood was 13-fold and 3.6-fold higher in the control bee hives than in those treated with Apistan and with the fungus, respectively. Like the miticide Apistan, the fungal treatments provided a significant reduction of mite populations at the end of the experimental period. The data from the broodless colonies treated with the fungus indicated that optimum mite control could be achieved when no brood is being produced, or when brood production is low, such as in the early spring or late fall. In established colonies in Florida, honey bee colony development did not increase under either Apistan or fungal treatments at the end of the experimental period, suggesting that other factors (queen health, food source, food availability) play some major role in the growth of bee colonies. Overall, microbial control of Varroa mites with fungal pathogens could be a useful component of an integrated pest management program for the honey bee industry.},

The concentration × time {(CT)} product is a valuable tool for studying fumigants and how they might perform under various environmental conditions. This laboratory study is an assessment of the efficacy of formic acid against the varroa mite under a range of formic acid concentrations and temperatures. The objectives are 1) to determine the effect of temperature and dose of formic acid on worker honey bee and varroa mite survival, 2) to determine the {CT} 50 products for both honey bees and varroa mites and 3) to determine the best temperature and dose to optimize selectivity of formic acid treatment for control of varroa mites. Worker honey bees and varroa mites were fumigated at 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, and 0.16 {mg/L} at 5, 15, 25, and 35 {°C} for 12 d. Mite and bee mortality were assessed at regular intervals. Both mite and bee survival were affected by formic acid dose. Doses of 0.08 and 0.16 {mg/L} were effective at killing mites at all temperatures tested above 5 {°C.} There was a significant interaction between temperature, dose, and species for the {CT} 50 product. The difference between the {CT} 50 product of bees and mites was significant at only a few temperature-dose combinations. {CT} product values showed that at most temperatures the greatest fumigation efficiency occurred at lower doses of formic acid. However, the best fumigation efficiency and selectivity combination for treatments occurred at a dose of 0.16 {mg/L} when the temperature was 35 {°C.}},

	abstract = {Data on the seasonal reproductive patterns of the honey bee tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi {(Rennie)}, were obtained by dissecting host honey bees, Apis mellifera L., at intervals during their life span. Mite reproduction normally was limited to 1 complete generation per host bee, regardless of host life span. However, limited egg laying by foundress progeny was observed. Longer lived bees in the fall and winter harbored mites that reproduced for a longer period than did mites in bees during spring and summer. Oviposition rate was relatively uniform at ≍0.85 eggs per female per day during the initial 16 d of adult bee life regardless of season. In all seasons, peak mite populations occurred in bees ≍24 d old, with egg laying declining rapidly beyond day 24 in spring and summer bees but more slowly in fall and winter bees. Stadial lengths of eggs and male and female larvae were 5, 4, and 5 d, respectively. Sex ratio ranged from 1.15:1 to 2.01:1, female bias, but because males are not known to migrate they would have been overestimated in the sampling scheme. Fecundity was estimated to be ≍21 offspring, assuming daughter mites laid limited eggs in tracheae before dispersal. Mortality of adult mites increased with host age; an estimate of 35 d for female mite longevity was indirectly obtained. Daughter mites began dispersing when infested bees were ≍13 d old, and mite dispersal peaked when infested bees were 15-25 d old. The mating behavior of tracheal mites is described.},

Mortality was not correlated with the level of mite infestation for either treatment. The ratio of the coefficient of variation in mite mortality among colonies in the formic acid group to the coefficient of variation among colonies in the Apistan group was 43.28, indicating that Apistan is a more reliable control agent than the formulation of formic acid used in this experiment. Overall, only 63\% of the 250-ml formic acid treatment evaporated during the 30-d treatment period, resulting in an average daily release of 5.26 g of formic acid, which is below that required for effective treatment.

The major strength of this resampling approach is that analyses are based on actual sampling distributions of arthropod populations, not those specified by a theoretical model. A limitation is that this approach does require additional planning and effort to collect an adequate number of independent data sets. The software {(Resampling} for Validation of Sample Plans {[RVSP])can} be used to test 2 fixed-precision sequential sampling plans based on enumerative counts and 2 (1 sequential and 1 fixed) sampling plans based on binomial counts.

We made 97 mini packages of Varroa -infested adult bees. Each package contained 1,613 ± 18 bees and 92 ± 3 mites, and represented an experimental unit. We prepared a 2.8\% solution of {OA} by mixing 35 g {OA} with 1 l of sugar water (sugar:water = 1:1; w:w). Eight treatments were assigned to the packages based on previous laboratory bioassays that characterized the acute contact toxicity of {OA} to mites and bees. We administered the treatments by spraying the {OA} solution directly on the bees through the mesh screen cage using a pressurized air brush and quantified mite and bee mortality over a 10-day period. Our results support applying an optimum volume of 3.0 ml of a 2.8\% {OA} solution per 1,000 bees to packages for effective mite control with minimal adult bee mortality. The outcome of our research provides beekeepers and package bee shippers guidance for using {OA} to reduce mite populations in package bees.},

	abstract = {The constant pressure posed by parasites has caused species throughout the animal kingdom to evolve suites of mechanisms to resist infection. Individual barriers and physiological defenses are considered the main barriers against parasites in invertebrate species. However, behavioral traits and other non-immunological defenses can also effectively reduce parasite transmission and infection intensity. In social insects, behaviors that reduce colony-level parasite loads are termed “social immunity.” One example of a behavioral defense is resin collection. Honey bees forage for plant-produced resins and incorporate them into their nest architecture. This use of resins can reduce chronic elevation of an individual bee's immune response. Since high activation of individual immunity can impose colony-level fitness costs, collection of resins may benefit both the individual and colony fitness. However the use of resins as a more direct defense against pathogens is unclear. Here we present evidence that honey bee colonies may self-medicate with plant resins in response to a fungal infection. Self-medication is generally defined as an individual responding to infection by ingesting or harvesting non-nutritive compounds or plant materials. Our results show that colonies increase resin foraging rates after a challenge with a fungal parasite {(Ascophaera} apis: chalkbrood or {CB).} Additionally, colonies experimentally enriched with resin had decreased infection intensities of this fungal parasite. If considered self-medication, this is a particularly unique example because it operates at the colony level. Most instances of self-medication involve pharmacophagy, whereby individuals change their diet in response to direct infection with a parasite. In this case with honey bees, resins are not ingested but used within the hive by adult bees exposed to fungal spores. Thus the colony, as the unit of selection, may be responding to infection through self-medication by increasing the number of individuals that forage for resin.},

	abstract = {European foulbrood {(EFB)} is an important infectious disease of honeybee larvae, but its pathogenic mechanisms are still poorly understood. The causative agent, Melissococcus plutonius, is a fastidious organism, and microaerophilic to anaerobic conditions and the addition of potassium phosphate to culture media are required for growth. Although M. plutonius is believed to be remarkably homologous, in addition to M. plutonius isolates with typical cultural characteristics, M. plutonius-like organisms, with characteristics seemingly different from those of typical M. plutonius, have often been isolated from diseased larvae with clinical signs of {EFB} in Japan. Cultural and biochemical characterization of 14 M. plutonius and 19 M. plutonius-like strain/isolates revealed that, unlike typical M. plutonius strain/isolates, M. plutonius-like isolates were not fastidious, and the addition of potassium phosphate was not required for normal growth. Moreover, only M. plutonius-like isolates, but not typical M. plutonius strain/isolates, grew anaerobically on sodium phosphate-supplemented medium and aerobically on some potassium salt-supplemented media, were positive for β-glucosidase activity, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced acid from L-arabinose, D-cellobiose, and salicin. Despite the phenotypic differences, {16S} {rRNA} gene sequence analysis and {DNA-DNA} hybridization demonstrated that M. plutonius-like organisms were taxonomically identical to M. plutonius. However, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, these typical and atypical {(M.} plutonius-like) isolates were separately grouped into two genetically distinct clusters. Although M. plutonius is known to lose virulence quickly when cultured artificially, experimental infection of representative isolates showed that atypical M. plutonius maintained the ability to cause {EFB} in honeybee larvae even after cultured in vitro in laboratory media. Because the rapid decrease of virulence in cultured M. plutonius was a major impediment to elucidation of the pathogenesis of {EFB}, atypical M. plutonius discovered in this study will be a breakthrough in {EFB} research.},

	abstract = {Although Nosema ceranae was first isolated from the Asian honeybee {(Apis} cerana) in Asia and then subsequently recognized as a widespread gut parasite of the Western honeybee {(Apis} mellifera), its origins and primary host are yet to be accurately established. In this study we examined the possibility of an Asian origin for the parasite by looking for evidence of its ongoing spread out of Asia. To do this, we surveyed for the presence of N. ceranae in A. cerana and A. mellifera on isolated islands of the Solomon Islands {(Pacific} region), most of which were inhabited with A. mellifera that had been introduced from Australia and New Zealand at a time when N. ceranae was not present in either country, but on which some had also recently become inhabited with invasive A. cerana that originated from Asia with no prior history of contact with A. mellifera infected with N. ceranae. We also sought to verify previous findings that N. ceranae was widespread in Asian honeybees by surveying for its presence in isolated populations of the Asian honeybees, A. cerana, A. koschevnikovi, A. nigrocincta and A. florea. We obtained evidence that A. cerana introduced N. ceranae to A. mellifera in the Solomon Islands and also confirmed the widespread occurrence of the parasite in Asian honeybees, even reporting it for the first time in A. koschevnikovi from Borneo.

Our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that N. ceranae has only recently emerged from Asia to become a parasite of A. mellifera.},

Sulfamethoxazole was the most frequently found antibiotic (often combined with trimethoprim). Almost all of the analyzed honeys from Argentina, China and Canada were {AFB-positive} (category I and {II)}, whereas only five German honeys were {AFB-positive.} A correlation of present antibiotics and {AFB} spores was not found. For investigating putative relations between imported honeys and {AFB} cases in the area of Hamburg, genomic fingerprinting by {PCR-amplification} of repetitive {DNA} elements of the bacterial isolates was performed. The study shows that distinct genotypes of P. larvae are prevalent in samples of different geographical origin. {AFB} isolates of imported honeys differ from the predominant genotype in the area of Hamburg. Furthermore, the prevalent genotype in Hamburg was characterized by the absence of the {iC9-fragment} which was shown to be linked to virulence of P. larvae strains.},

Detection of the causative agent, Paenibacillus larvae subspecies larvae , is a very important concern in order to prevent disease dissemination and decrease of honey production. Since spores are the infective forms of this pathogen, in the present work we report the use of polymerase chain reaction {(PCR)} to detect P. l. subsp. larvae spores from in vitro cultures, larvae with clinical symptoms and experimentally contaminated honey. The set of primers was designed based on the published P. l. subsp. larvae {16S} {rRNA} gene. Using this approach we could amplify the pathogen {DNA} and obtain a great sensitivity and a notable specificity. Detection limit for spore suspension was a 10 -2 dilution of template {DNA} obtained from 32 spores, as determined by plate count. For artificially contaminated honey, we could detect the {PCR} product at a 10 -3 dilution of template {DNA} obtained from 170 spores. In addition, when {PCR} conditions were set to improve specificity, we were able to amplify P. l . subsp. larvae {DNA} selectively and no cross-reactions were observed with a variety of related bacterial species, including P. l. subsp. pulvifaciens . Since spore detection is very important to confirm the presence of the disease, this method provides a reliable diagnosis of {AFB} from infected larvae and contaminated honey in a few hours.},

One of the hypotheses is that genetic variability would benefit the colony by increasing its resistance to parasites through various mechanisms. One among the predictions of this hypothesis is that the resistance of different patrilines within a colony to parasites of different species should be independent, as a result of independent gene-for-gene interactions with each parasite. To test this aspect of the hypothesis, two honeybee colonies ( Apis mellifera ) were infected with the fungus Ascosphaera apis and two colonies with both A. apis and the American foulbrood bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. Patrilines were found to vary in resistance of larvae to A. apis in all four colonies, but similar variation in resistance was not found to P. larvae. Common resistance to both pathogens was not detected. This study supports the hypothesis that polyandry in social insects could have originated as an adaptation to decrease the impact of diseases.},

Isolated viral particles were also observed in the hemolymph occupying the intercellular spaces of the muscular sheath fibers. In the muscle the virus appeared as polygonal crystalloid inclusions, while in the epithelium mainly inside cytoplasmic vesicles. The infected cells apparently are not damaged. The virus particles are present in the hemolymph and forming more mature structures, as crystalloids, in the muscle. This suggests that the virus is liberated in the body fluid and infects the tissues penetrating the cells through endocytosis.

	abstract = {Recent losses of honey bee colonies have led to increased interest in the microbial communities that are associated with these important pollinators. A critical function that bacteria perform for their honey bee hosts, but one that is poorly understood, is the transformation of worker-collected pollen into bee bread, a nutritious food product that can be stored for long periods in colonies. We used {16S} {rRNA} pyrosequencing to comprehensively characterize in genetically diverse and genetically uniform colonies the active bacterial communities that are found on honey bees, in their digestive tracts, and in bee bread. This method provided insights that have not been revealed by past studies into the content and benefits of honey bee-associated microbial communities. Colony microbiotas differed substantially between sampling environments and were dominated by several anaerobic bacterial genera never before associated with honey bees, but renowned for their use by humans to ferment food. Colonies with genetically diverse populations of workers, a result of the highly promiscuous mating behavior of queens, benefited from greater microbial diversity, reduced pathogen loads, and increased abundance of putatively helpful bacteria, particularly species from the potentially probiotic genus Bifidobacterium. Across all colonies, Bifidobacterium activity was negatively correlated with the activity of genera that include pathogenic microbes; this relationship suggests a possible target for understanding whether microbes provide protective benefits to honey bees. Within-colony diversity shapes microbiotas associated with honey bees in ways that may have important repercussions for colony function and health. Our findings illuminate the importance of honey bee-bacteria symbioses and examine their intersection with nutrition, pathogen load, and genetic diversity, factors that are considered key to understanding honey bee decline.},

As a rapid detection method, ultra-rapid real-time {PCR} {(URRT-PCR)} was carried out with a {GenSpector} {TMC-1000} silicon-glass chip-based thermal cycler, which has a 6\&\#xa0;μl micro-chamber volume and a fast outstandingly heating/cooling rate. Using this method, 103\&\#xa0;copies of {pBX-SBV3.8} clone were detected within 17\&\#xa0;min after 40 {PCR} cycles, including melting point analysis. To reduce the detection time for {SBV}, synthesis of the {cDNA} of the {SBV} genome from a honeybee sample was attempted for different reaction times and the {cDNA} was used as the template for {URRT-PCR} assays. The results indicated that a 5\&\#xa0;min reaction time was sufficient to synthesize {cDNA} as the template for the {SBV} {URRT-PCR} assay. This study described a novel {PCR-based} method that is able to detect an {RNA} virus in environmental samples within 22\&\#xa0;min, including reverse transcription, {PCR} detection and melting point analysis in real-time.},

	abstract = {The aim of this research was to investigate whether or not sugar dusting can stimulate the grooming behaviour in Apis mellifera L. {(Hymenoptera:} Apidae), an important defensive mechanism against Varroa destructor Anderson \& Trueman {(Acari:} Varroidae), and to assess the most effective dose and frequency of treatment. The criterion for evaluation of grooming potential was the percentage of damaged mites {(PDM)} among the total number collected on the bottom boards of the hives. In each sugar-treated group {PDM} was significantly higher in comparison both with the negative control (no treatment) and with the values preceding the treatment. The results point to a stimulating effect of sugar on the grooming behaviour at all doses and frequencies tested. Treatment frequency influenced the stimulating effect of sugar: treatments at 3- and 7-day intervals with 30 and 40 g resulted in significantly higher {PDMs} than the least frequent treatment (every 14 days); dusting with 20 g influenced {PDM} only when repeated at 3-day intervals. Because treatments at 3-day intervals are time-consuming, those with 40 or 30 g repeated every 7 days may be recommended. In the positive control (hives treated with amitraz), average {PDM} was significantly lower than in the negative control and all sugar-treated groups. Possible causes of the stimulating effect of sugar dusting on bee grooming behaviour are discussed.},

Sample size computations for such trials need to take into account between-cluster variation, but field epidemiologists find it difficult to obtain simple guidance on such procedures. {METHODS:} In this paper, we provide simple formulae for sample size determination for both unmatched and pair-matched trials. Outcomes considered include rates per person-year, proportions and means. For simplicity, formulae are expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation {(SD/mean)} of cluster rates, proportions or means. Guidance is also given on the estimation of this value, with or without the use of prior data on between-cluster variation. {CASE} {STUDIES:} The methods are illustrated using two case studies: an unmatched trial of the impact of impregnated bednets on child mortality in Kenya, and a pair-matched trial of improved sexually-transmitted disease {(STD)} treatment services for {HIV} prevention in Tanzania.},

	abstract = {Much of the world’s food production is dependent on honey bees for pollination, and expanding food production will further increase the demand for managed pollination services. Apiculturists outside the native range of the honey bee, in the Americas, Australia and eastern Asia, have used only a few of the 27 described subspecies of honey bees {(Apis} mellifera) for beekeeping purposes. Within the endemic ranges of a particular subspecies, hybridisation can threaten native subspecies when local beekeepers import and propagate non-native honey bees. For many threatened species, cryopreserved germplasm can provide a resource for the preservation of diversity and recovery of endangered populations. However, although instrumental insemination of queen honey bees is well established, the absence of an effective means to cryopreserve honey bee semen has limited the success of efforts to preserve genetic diversity within the species or to develop repositories of honey bee germplasm for breeding purposes. Herein we report that some queens inseminated with cryopreserved semen were capable of producing a substantial number of fertilised offspring. These diploid female larvae were used to produce two additional sequential generations of new queens, which were then back-crossed to the same stock of frozen semen. Our results demonstrate the ability to produce queens using cryopreserved honey bee spermatozoa and the potential for the establishment of a honey bee genetic repository.},

Bees were either treated topically with 0.3, 1.5, and 3 µg tau-fluvalinate or exposed to 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, 50, and 500 ppb imidacloprid in a sugar agar cube. Tau-fluvalinate caused a significant reduction in distance moved at all dose levels (p {\textless} 0.05), as did 50 and 500 ppb imidacloprid (p {\textless} 0.001). Bees exposed to 50 and 500 ppb spent significantly more time near the food source than control bees (p {\textless} 0.05). Interaction time decreased as time in the food zone increased for both chemicals. This study documents that video-tracking of bee behavior can enhance current protocols for measuring the effects of pesticides on honey bees at sublethal levels. It may provide a means of identifying problematic compounds for further testing. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. © 2012 {SETAC}},

	abstract = {Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian parasite of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, that is found worldwide and in multiple Apis spp.; however, little is known about the effects of N. ceranae on A. mellifera. Previous studies using spore counts suggest that there is no longer a seasonal cycle for N. ceranae and that it is found year round with little variation in infection intensity among months. Our goal was to determine whether infection levels differ in bees collected from different areas of the hive and if there may be seasonal differences in N. ceranae infections. A multiplex species-specific real-time {PCR} assay was used for the detection and quantification of N. ceranae. Colonies were sampled monthly from September 2009–2010 by collecting workers from honey supers, the fringe of the brood nest, and the brood nest. We found that all bees sampled were infected with N. ceranae and that there was no significant difference in infection levels among the different groups of bees sampled {(P\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.74).} However, significant differences in colony infection levels were found at different times of the year {(P\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.01)} with the highest levels in {April–June} and lower levels in the fall and winter. While our study was only performed for one year, it sheds light on the fact that there may be a seasonality to N. ceranae infections. Being able to predict future N. ceranae infections can be used to better advise beekeepers on N. ceranae management.},

Minimal inhibitory concentration {(MIC)} in {Mueller–Hinton} broth by the microdilution method was assessed. Andiroba registered {MIC} values of 1.56–25\%, while the {MICs} values obtained for Copaíba oil were of 1.56–12.5\%. In order to determine the time-response effect of essential oils on P. larvae, this microorganism was exposed to the oils for up to 48\&\#xa0;h. After 24\&\#xa0;h treatment with Andiroba oil and after 48\&\#xa0;h treatment with Copaíba oil no viable cells of P. larvae {ATCC} 9545 were observed. The possible toxic effect of essential oils were assessed by the spraying application method of the same concentrations of {MICs.} Bee mortality was evident only in treatment with Andiroba oil and the Copaíba oil shows no toxic effects after 10\&\#xa0;days of observation. Taking together ours results showed for the first time that these oils presented a high activity against Paenibacillus species showing that Copaíba oil may be a candidate for the treatment or prevention of {AFB.}},

Fifty-eight newlyestablished 1.3-kg (3-lb) colonies treated three times with {SuperBoost} at 5-wk intervals starting 30 April 2009 were compared with 52 untreated control colonies. Treated colonies produced 84.3\% more honey than untreated control colonies. By 8 September 2009, {SuperBoost-treated} colonies had 35.4\% more adults than untreated colonies. By 28 September, net survival of treated and control colonies was 72.4 and 67.3\%, respectively. On 5 October, treated and control colonies were divided into two additional groups, making up four cohorts: {SuperBoost-treated} colonies treated again during fall and spring build-up feeding with pollen substitute diet {(BeePro}, Mann Lake Ltd., Hackensack, {MN;} {TTT);} controls that remained untreated throughout the year {(CCC);} colonies treated with {SuperBoost} in spring-summer 2009 but not treated thereafter {(TCC);} and original control colonies treated with {SuperBoost} during the fall and spring build-up feeding periods {(CTT).} There was no difference among cohorts in consumption of {BeePro} during fall feeding, but {TTT} colonies (including daughter colonies split off from parent colonies) consumed 50.8\% more diet than {CCC} colonies during spring build-up feeding. By 21 April, the normalized percentages of the original number of colonies remaining (dead colonies partially offset by splits) were as follows: {CCC}, 31.4\%; {CTT}, 43.8\%; {TCC}, 53.59\%; and {TTT}, 80.0\%.

All brood cells were observed, daily in most cases, for about two weeks, to learn whether or not the adult bees had removed the brood contained therein. By the end of the experiment, two of the inbred lines, with a history of resistance to American foulbrood, had removed from their cells all but three individuals of the several hundred which did not survive. The two other inbred lines, with a history of susceptibility to American foulbrood, allowed hundreds of individuals dead of the disease to remain in the broodnest.

These larvae were then assayed for {RNA} levels of genes encoding two antibacterial peptides, abaecin and defensin. Larvae exposed to either P. l. larvae or a mix of nonpathogenic bacteria showed high {RNA} levels for the abaecin gene relative to controls. First instars responded significantly to the presence of the nonpathogenic mix within 12 h after exposure, a time when they remain highly susceptible to bacterial invasion. This response was sustained for two successive instars, eventually becoming 21-fold higher in larvae exposed to probiotic spores versus control larvae. The mixture of nonpathogenic bacteria is therefore presented as a potential surrogate for assaying the immune responses of different honey bee lineages. It also is proposed that nonpathogenic bacteria can be used as a probiotic to enhance honey bee immunity, helping bee larvae, and other life stages, survive attacks from pathogens in the field.},

Moreover, in mite-infested bee pupae, {DWV} had amplified to extremely high titers with viral genomic {RNA} being clearly visible after separation of total bee {RNA} in agarose gels. Linear regression analysis has shown a positive correlation between the number of mites introduced and the levels of viral {RNAs.} The detection of viral {RNAs} in the nymph and adult mites underline the possible role of varroa in virus transmission. However, most groups of virus-free adult mites (9/12) were associated with bee pupae heavily infected by viruses, suggesting that the elevated viral titers in mite-infested pupae more likely resulted from activated viral replication. Based on these observations and our concurrent research demonstrating suppressed immune responses in bees infested with mites, we propose that parasitization by varroa suppresses the immunity of honey bees, leading to activation of persistent, latent viral infection.},

Eggs, prepupae, pupae, and worker bees emerging from cells as adults are usually free of internal microbes. Microorganisms acquired by larvae through ingestion of contaminated food are usually eliminated through the single defecation that occurs at the end of the feeding period prior to pupation. Emerging adult bees acquire intestinal microflora by food exchange with other bees in the colony and through consumption of pollen. Biochemical contributions of microorganisms to honey bees; the role of microorganisms in the conversion, enhancement, and preservation of pollen stored as bee bread in comb cells; and the production of antimycotic substances by molds and Bacillus spp. from honey bee colonies that are resistant to the fungal disease, chalkbrood, are discussed. An association of Bacillus spp. with bees including honey bees, stingless bees, and solitary bees from tropical and temperate zones appears to have evolved in which female bees inoculate food sources with these bacteria whose chemical products contribute to the elaboration and/or protection from spoilage of food that is stored in the nest. This association is ancient based on results from stingless bees preserved in amber for 25–40 million years. It is concluded that bees, their products, and their associated microorganisms are potential sources of bioactive products including antimicrobial compounds.},

	abstract = {Chalkbrood {(Ascosphaera} apis) and stonebrood {(Aspergillus} flavus) are well known fungal brood diseases of honeybees {(Apis} mellifera), but they have hardly been systematically studied because the difficulty of rearing larvae in vitro has precluded controlled experimentation. Chalkbrood is a chronic honeybee-specific disease that can persist in colonies for years, reducing both brood and honey production, whereas stonebrood is a rare facultative pathogen that also affects hosts other than honeybees and can likely survive outside insect hosts. Hive infection trials have indicated that accidental drops in comb temperature increase the prevalence of chalkbrood, but it has remained unclear whether virulence is directly temperature-dependent. We used a newly established in vitro rearing technique for honeybee larvae to test whether there are systematic temperature effects on mortality induced by controlled infections, and whether such effects differed between the two fungal pathogens. We found that increasing spore dosage at infection had a more dramatic effect on mortality from stonebrood compared to chalkbrood. In addition, a 24\&\#xa0;h cooling period after inoculation increased larval mortality from chalkbrood infection, whereas such a cooling period decreased mortality after stonebrood infection. These results raise interesting questions about honeybee defenses against obligate and facultative pathogens and about the extent to which stress factors in the host (dis)favor pathogens with lesser degrees of specialization.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Bumble bees are a group of pollinators that are both ecologically and economically important and declining worldwide. Numerous mechanisms could be behind this decline, and the spread of parasites from commercial colonies into wild populations has been implicated recently in North America. Commercial breeding may lead to declines because commercial colonies may have high parasite loads, which can lead to colonization of native bumble bee populations; commercial rearing may allow higher parasite virulence to evolve; and global movement of commercial colonies may disrupt spatial patterns in local adaptation between hosts and parasites. We assessed parasite virulence, transmission mode, and infectivity. Microparasites and so-called honey bee viruses may pose the greatest threat to native bumble bee populations because certain risk factors are present; for example, the probability of horizontal transmission of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi is high. The microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi may play a role in declines of bumble bees in the United States. Preliminary indications that C. bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi may not be native in parts of South America. We suggest that the development of molecular screening protocols, thorough sanitation efforts, and cooperation among nongovernmental organizations, governments, and commercial breeders might immediately mitigate these threats.},

Paenibacillus proliferates in the killed insect along with Heterorhabditis and its obligate bacterial symbiont, Photorhabdus , despite the antibiotic production of the latter. Nematode infective juveniles leave the insect cadaver with Paenibacillus sporangia attached. The specificity of the relationship between Paenibacillus and Heterorhabditis was investigated. Sporangia of nematode-associated Paenibacillus adhered to infective juveniles (but not other stages) of all Heterorhabditis species tested, and to infective juveniles of vertebrate parasitic Strongylida species, but not to a variety of other soil nematodes tested. Paenibacillus species that were not isolated from nematodes, but were phylogenetically close to the nematode-associated strains, did not adhere to Heterorhabditis , and they were also sensitive to Photorhabdus antibiotics in vitro , whereas the nematode-associated strains were not. Unusual longevity of the sporangium and resistance to Photorhabdus antibiotics may represent specific adaptations of the nematode-associated Paenibacillus strains to allow them to coexist with and be transported by Heterorhabditis . Adaptation to specific Heterorhabditis-Photorhabdus strains is evident among the three nematode-associated Paenibacillus strains (each from a different nematode strain). Paenibacillus {NEM1a} and {NEM3} each developed best in cadavers with the nematode from which it was isolated and not at all with the nematode associate of the other strain. Differences between nematode-associated Paenibacillus strains in cross-compatibility with the various Heterorhabditis strains in cadavers could not be explained by differential sensitivity to antibiotics produced by the nematodes’ Photorhabdus symbionts in vitro .},

	url = {https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/23335},
	abstract = {The honey bee Apis mellifera is an extremely beneficial insect due to its role in pollination and honey production. Honey bees are vulnerable to many diseases, one of which is caused by the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. Ingestion of its spores by honey bees early in their larval stage results in death before adulthood. This disease is known as American foulbrood. Interestingly, this deadly consequence does not occur when older larvae or adults consume the spores, a phenomenon which we hypothesize to be the result of an underdeveloped immune system in young larvae. To address this issue, we mainly employed mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques to learn about the protein effectors that are present in the host. We focused on the hemolymph (insect blood) where a significant repertoire of immunity-related proteins exists. In our comparison of adults and larvae, we saw age-correlated differences in the levels of the antimicrobial peptide hymenoptaecin, the phenoloxidase enzyme which lead to the production of cytotoxic free radicals, and several bacterial recognition proteins. This prompted a detailed study of the larval development in which many new expression trends were revealed; for example, the age-related decrease of antioxidant proteins, proteins associated with translational machinery, and enzymes related to protein turnover. Unexpectedly, most immunity-related proteins showed no significant age correlation, except the antimicrobial peptide apisimin and phenoloxidase. The latter protein was particularly intriguing, given that its increased expression and activity with respect to age agreed with the buildup of resistance against P. larvae. Furthermore, this protein was upregulated in P. larvae infected larvae compared to healthy controls. This enzyme may be an important factor of the host immune response. The decrease of nutrient storage proteins in the diseased state which we observed also implied that the defense response was mounted with an associated energetic cost. Data from the work covered in this thesis has helped explain, from a molecular point-of-view, the pathogenesis of American foulbrood. Although our focus was on honey bee immunity, the proteomics-based approach taken here has provided protein evidence and expression data that will serve as a resource for the wider scientific community.},

Trans-generational effects on immunity are well known from vertebrates, but their existence in invertebrates remains controversial. Earlier work on invertebrates has interpreted increased offspring resistance to pathogens as trans-generational immune priming. However, interpretation of these earlier studies involves some caveats and thus full evidence for a direct effect of maternal immune experience on offspring immunity is still lacking in invertebrates. Here we show that induced levels of antibacterial activity are higher in the worker offspring of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L., when their mother queen received a corresponding immune challenge prior to colony founding. This shows trans-generational immune priming in an insect, with ramifications for the evolution of sociality.},

	abstract = {The extraordinary diversity and ecological success of the social insects has been attributed to their ability to cope with the rich and often infectious microbial community inhabiting their nests and feeding sites. Mechanisms of disease control used by eusocial species include antibiotic glandular secretions, mutual grooming, removal of diseased individuals from the nest, and the innate and adaptive immune responses of colony members. Here we demonstrate that after a challenge exposure to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, dampwood termites Zootermopsis angusticollis have higher survivorship when individuals develop immunity as group members. Furthermore, termites significantly improve their ability to resist infection when they are placed in contact with previously immunized nestmates. This “social transfer” of infection resistance, a previously unrecognized mechanism of disease control in the social insects, could explain how group living may improve the survivorship of colony members despite the increased risks of pathogen transmission that can accompany sociality.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract Evolutionary ecology seeks to understand the selective reasons for the design features of the immune defense, especially with respect to parasitism. The molecular processes thereby set limitations, such as the failure to recognize an antigen, response specificity, the cost of defense, and the risk of autoimmunity. Sex, resource availability, and interference by parasites also affect a response. In turn, the defense repertoire consists of different kinds of immune responses—constitutive or induced, general or specific—and involves memory and lasting protection. Because the situation often defies intuition, mathematical analysis is typically required to identify the costs and benefits of variation in design, but such studies are few. In all, insect immune defense is much more similar to that of vertebrates than previously thought. In addition, the field is now rapidly becoming revolutionized by molecular data and methods that allow unprecedented access to study evolution in action.},

	abstract = {Recent elevated winter loss of honey bee colonies is a major concern. The presence of the mite Varroa destructor in colonies places an important pressure on bee health. V. destructor shortens the lifespan of individual bees, while long lifespan during winter is a primary requirement to survive until the next spring. We investigated in two subsequent years the effects of different levels of V. destructor infestation during the transition from short-lived summer bees to long-lived winter bees on the lifespan of individual bees and the survival of bee colonies during winter. Colonies treated earlier in the season to reduce V. destructor infestation during the development of winter bees were expected to have longer bee lifespan and higher colony survival after winter.

Mite infestation was reduced using acaricide treatments during different months {(July}, August, September, or not treated). We found that the number of capped brood cells decreased drastically between August and November, while at the same time, the lifespan of the bees (marked cohorts) increased indicating the transition to winter bees. Low V. destructor infestation levels before and during the transition to winter bees resulted in an increase in lifespan of bees and higher colony survival compared to colonies that were not treated and that had higher infestation levels. A variety of stress-related factors could have contributed to the variation in longevity and winter survival that we found between years.

This study contributes to theory about the multiple causes for the recent elevated colony losses in honey bees. Our study shows the correlation between long lifespan of winter bees and colony loss in spring. Moreover, we show that colonies treated earlier in the season had reduced V. destructor infestation during the development of winter bees resulting in longer bee lifespan and higher colony survival after winter.},

On the remaining five farms, the mean faecal egg count reduction ranged between 97.7 and 99.9\%. The mean cyathostomin {FECR} following {PYR} treatment ranged between 92.2 and 100\% on the 25 farms tested. Therefore, based on the 90\% {FECR} threshold suggested for detection of anthelmintic resistance in horses, neither {IVM} nor {PYR} anthelmintic resistance was detected. However, if the thresholds recommended for the detection of resistance in small ruminants were applied, on one and four farms signs of reduced {IVM} and {PYR} efficacy, respectively, were observed. In 2005, to further investigate these findings, the cyathostomin egg-reappearance period {(ERP)} following {IVM} treatment was examined on six selected farms, two of which were found to show less than 99.8\% {FECR} in the previous survey. On these two latter farms, the {ERP} was less than 5 weeks, while on the other four it was at least 8 weeks. Earlier investigations described {IVM} cyathostomin {ERP} of at least 9 weeks. The efficacy of {IVM} to reduce Parascaris equorum egg excretion was also studied. On one farm in 2 consecutive years, {IVM} treatment did not lead to a significant reduction in P. equorum faecal egg counts in one and five young horses, respectively.},

	abstract = {The aim of this research was to investigate whether or not sugar dusting can stimulate the grooming behaviour in Apis mellifera L. {(Hymenoptera:} Apidae), an important defensive mechanism against Varroa destructor Anderson \& Trueman {(Acari:} Varroidae), and to assess the most effective dose and frequency of treatment. The criterion for evaluation of grooming potential was the percentage of damaged mites {(PDM)} among the total number collected on the bottom boards of the hives. In each sugar-treated group {PDM} was significantly higher in comparison both with the negative control (no treatment) and with the values preceding the treatment. The results point to a stimulating effect of sugar on the grooming behaviour at all doses and frequencies tested. Treatment frequency influenced the stimulating effect of sugar: treatments at 3- and 7-day intervals with 30 and 40 g resulted in significantly higher {PDMs} than the least frequent treatment (every 14 days); dusting with 20 g influenced {PDM} only when repeated at 3-day intervals. Because treatments at 3-day intervals are time-consuming, those with 40 or 30 g repeated every 7 days may be recommended. In the positive control (hives treated with amitraz), average {PDM} was significantly lower than in the negative control and all sugar-treated groups. Possible causes of the stimulating effect of sugar dusting on bee grooming behaviour are discussed.},

	abstract = {A simulation study is used to examine the statistical behaviour of estimators of parameters of parasite infection in relation to variation in sample size, the degree of parasite aggregation, and mean parasite burden. The most important patterns to emerge are the associations between estimates of parameters and sample size (= number of host individuals). As sample size decreases values of sample mean parasite burden, its associated variance, and the level of parasite aggregation are all systematically underestimated. The geometric mean of parasite burden and the prevalence of infection appear to be independent of associations with other parasite parameters. Estimates of parameter values may also depend on the underlying frequency distribution, but appear insensitive to variation in the population mean parasite burden. Results are discussed in relation to the interpretation of data derived from field-based studies. In particular, establishing the form of the relationship between host age and mean parasite burden and/or the degree of parasite aggregation. It is typical for sample size to decline as a function of host age within cross-sectional field data. This may give rise to artefactual patterns in the shape of age-aggregation curves in which sample sizes are unequal among host age classes.},

	abstract = {Anthelmintic resistance {(AR)} is a serious problem for the control of equine gastrointestinal nematodes, particularly in the cyathostomins. The fecal egg count reduction test {(FECRT)} is the most common method for diagnosing {AR} and serves as the practical gold standard. However, accurate quantification of resistance and especially accurate diagnosis of emerging resistance to avermectin/milbemycin {(A/M)} drugs, is hampered by a lack of accepted standards for study design, data analysis, and data interpretation. In order to develop rational evidence-based standards for diagnosis of resistance, one must first take into account the numerous sources of variability, both biological and technical, that affect the measurement of fecal egg counts {(FECs).} Though usually ignored, these issues can greatly impact the observed efficacy. Thus, to accurately diagnose resistance on the basis of {FECRT} data, it is important to reduce levels of variability through improved study design, and then deal with inherent variability that cannot be removed, by performing thorough and proper statistical analysis. In this paper we discuss these issues in detail, and provide an explanation of the statistical models and methods that are most appropriate for analyzing these types of data. We also provide several examples using data from laboratory, field, and simulation experiments illustrating the benefits of these approaches.},

The adaptive significance of polyandry by social insect queens remains an evolutionary puzzle. Using the honeybee {(Apis} mellifera), we tested the hypothesis that polyandry improves a colony's resistance to disease. We established colonies headed by queens that had been artificially inseminated by either one or 10 drones. Later, we inoculated these colonies with spores of Paenibacillus larvae, the bacterium that causes a highly virulent disease of honeybee larvae {(American} foulbrood). We found that, on average, colonies headed by multiple-drone inseminated queens had markedly lower disease intensity and higher colony strength at the end of the summer relative to colonies headed by single-drone inseminated queens. These findings support the hypothesis that polyandry by social insect queens is an adaptation to counter disease within their colonies.},

Protocols for detection of sub-clinical levels of the bacterium from honey and bee samples include heat treatment of samples. The main objective of this study was to investigate if there is variability in temperature resistance among P. larvae genotypes, potentially leading to biased diagnose and disease monitoring. The variation in germination and proliferation ability among type collection {(N\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;4)} and field isolates {(N\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;4)} of P. larvae representing four different genotypes was investigated. Results demonstrate a significant variability between P. larvae genotypes in germination rate on solid media as well as in endospore resistance to heat treatment and storage. It is concluded that strains of different genotypes should be included in evaluation of standard laboratory protocols for cultivation of P. larvae to avoid bias in disease monitoring and quantification of the pathogen.},

	abstract = {The Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test {(FECRT)} is the most widely used method of assessing the efficacy of anthelmintics, and is the only in vivo technique currently approved for use with horses. Equine Faecal Egg Count {(FEC)} data are frequently characterised by a low mean, high variability, small sample size and frequent zero count observations. Accurate analysis of the data therefore depends on the use of an appropriate statistical technique. Analyses of simulated {FECRT} data by methods based on calculation of the empirical mean and variance, non-parametric bootstrapping, and Markov chain Monte Carlo {(MCMC)} are compared. The {MCMC} method consistently outperformed the other methods, independently of the distribution from which the data were generated. Bootstrapping produced notional 95\% confidence intervals containing the true parameter as little as 40\% of the time with sample sizes of less than 50. Analysis of equine {FECRT} data yielded inconclusive results in 53 of 63 (84\%) datasets, suggesting that the routine use of prior sample size calculations should be adopted to ensure sufficient data are collected. The authors conclude that computationally intensive parametric methods such as {MCMC} be used for analysis of {FECRT} data with sample sizes of less than 50, in order to avoid erroneous inference about the true efficacy of anthelmintics in the field.},

	abstract = {The faecal egg count {(FEC)} is the most widely used means of quantifying the nematode burden of horses, and is frequently used in clinical practice to inform treatment and prevention. The statistical process underlying the {FEC} is complex, comprising a Poisson counting error process for each sample, compounded with an underlying continuous distribution of means between samples. Being able to quantify the sources of variability contributing to this distribution of means is a necessary step towards providing estimates of statistical power for future {FEC} and {FECRT} studies, and may help to improve the usefulness of the {FEC} technique by identifying and minimising unwanted sources of variability. Obtaining such estimates require a hierarchical statistical model coupled with repeated {FEC} observations from a single animal over a short period of time. Here, we use this approach to provide the first comparative estimate of multiple sources of within-horse {FEC} variability. The results demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the observed variation in {FEC} between horses occurs as a result of variation in {FEC} within an animal, with the major sources being aggregation of eggs within faeces and variation in egg concentration between faecal piles. The {McMaster} procedure itself is associated with a comparatively small coefficient of variation, and is therefore highly repeatable when a sufficiently large number of eggs are observed to reduce the error associated with the counting process. We conclude that the variation between samples taken from the same animal is substantial, but can be reduced through the use of larger homogenised faecal samples. Estimates are provided for the coefficient of variation (cv) associated with each within animal source of variability in observed {FEC}, allowing the usefulness of individual {FEC} to be quantified, and providing a basis for future {FEC} and {FECRT} studies.},

Of 145 samples infected with the protozoan Nosema apis , there were 23 cases of coinfections with the {BQCV} virus, 18 with the {DWV} virus and 11 with the {ABPV} virus. All coinfections with three or four viruses were also statistically significant apart from the one between {ABPV} with {CBPV} and {DWV.} The {PCA} ordination diagram indicates that {BQCV} occurs mainly with Nosema apis and {DWV} mainly with {ABPV.}},

Here, the basis of differences between the Bayesian method and the classical or frequentist approach to statistical inference is explained. This is illustrated with practical implications of Bayesian analyses using prevalence estimation of strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis as two relevant examples. The strongyloidiasis example addresses the problem of parasitological diagnosis in the absence of a gold standard, whereas the onchocerciasis case focuses on the identification of villages warranting priority mass ivermectin treatment. The advantages and challenges faced by users of the Bayesian approach are also discussed and the readers pointed to further directions for a more in-depth exploration of the issues raised. We advocate collaboration between parasitologists and Bayesian statisticians as a fruitful and rewarding venture for advancing applied research in parasite epidemiology and the control of parasitic infections.},

	abstract = {The faecal egg count reduction {(FECR)} in faeces is the most widely used method to assess the efficacy of anthelmintics against gastrointestinal strongyles. Several methods are used and they yield different efficacy values. They give important weight to those animals which excrete the majority of eggs, before or after treatment. We propose using individual animal {FECR} tests that give equal weight to every tested host. The first method is based on a before and after treatment without untreated controls, whereas the second one takes into account the use of non-treated control hosts. Confidence interval at P=0.95 were established on bootstrap resamples for both individual-based methods. The individual-based {FECR} presented lower values than the average-based {FECR} in most cases. The individual {FECR} provided reliable evaluation when egg counts were over 300\&\#xa0;eggs/g and when at least 10 animals were tested.},

	abstract = {Explaining the contribution of host and pathogen factors in driving infection dynamics is a major ambition in parasitology. There is increasing recognition that analyses based on single summary measures of an infection (e.g., peak parasitaemia) do not adequately capture infection dynamics and so, the appropriate use of statistical techniques to analyse dynamics is necessary to understand infections and, ultimately, control parasites. However, the complexities of within-host environments mean that tracking and analysing pathogen dynamics within infections and among hosts poses considerable statistical challenges. Simple statistical models make assumptions that will rarely be satisfied in data collected on host and parasite parameters. In particular, model residuals (unexplained variance in the data) should not be correlated in time or space. Here we demonstrate how failure to account for such correlations can result in incorrect biological inference from statistical analysis. We then show how mixed effects models can be used as a powerful tool to analyse such repeated measures data in the hope that this will encourage better statistical practices in parasitology.},

Because the accuracy of prevalence estimates is lower with small sample sizes, addressing sample size has been a common problem when dealing with prevalence data.

	abstract = {Before revised World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology {(WAAVP)} guidelines on the detection of anthelmintic resistance can be produced, validation of modified and new methods is required in laboratories in different parts of the world. There is a great need for improved methods of detection of anthelmintic resistance particularly for the detection of macrocyclic lactone resistance and for the detection of resistant nematodes in cattle. Therefore, revised and new methods are provided here for the detection of anthelmintic resistance in nematodes of ruminants, horses and pigs as a basis for discussion and with the purpose that they are evaluated internationally to establish whether they could in the future be recommended by the {WAAVP.} The interpretation of the faecal egg count reduction test has been modified and suggestions given on its use with persistent anthelmintics and continuous release devices. An egg hatch test for benzimidazole {(BZ)} resistance is described. A microagar larval development test for the detection of benzimidazole and levamisole resistance provides third stage larvae for the identification of resistant worms. The sensitivity of these two tests can be increased by using discriminating doses rather than {LD50} values. Details are given of a {PCR} based test for the analysis of benzimidazole resistance in strongyles of sheep and goats, horses and cattle. Although promising for ruminant trichostrongyles, quantitative determination of gene frequency using real time {PCR} requires further development before {PCR} tests will be used in the field. Apart from faecal egg count reduction tests there are currently no satisfactory tests for macrocylic lactone resistance despite the great importance of this subject. Except for treatment and slaughter trials there are no validated tests for fasciolicide resistance or for the detection of resistance in cestodes.},

	abstract = {Anthelmintic resistance has become an increasing problem particularly to gastrointestinal tract nematodes and appropriate methods are required to detect this phenomenon so the correct action can be taken. This paper compares a number of mathematical techniques that are used to analyse data. The negative binomial distribution is a mathematical distribution used to model aggregated data and hence is suitable to model the intensity of parasite burden and the magnitude of the faecal egg counts. Maximum likelihood techniques are utilised to exploit this mathematical distribution to analyse the magnitude of the faecal egg count reduction and decline in the worm burden in response to anthelmintic treatment. Data from experimental groups of sheep described in the accompanying paper are used. In addition, simulated data sets of faecal egg counts were created using a random number generator following appropriate negative binomial distributions. The results demonstrate this statistical model can detect evidence of anthelmintic resistance with a faecal egg reduction test that otherwise might require a slaughter trial to demonstrate. In addition, the simulated data sets confirm that there is a significant probability of failure to detect low anthelmintic efficacy with commonly used mathematical techniques. Consequently, the use of maximum likelihood mathematical techniques with a negative binomial statistical model would aid in the early detection of anthelmintic resistance using faecal egg count reductions and result in a lower probability of inappropriately assigning an anthelmintic as effective.},

	abstract = {The use of transformations to stabilize the variance of binomial or Poisson data is {familiar(Anscombe} [1], Bartlett [2, 3], Curtiss [4], Eisenhart [5]). The comparison of transformed binomial or Poisson data with percentage points of the normal distribution to make approximate significance tests or to set approximate confidence intervals is less familiar. Mosteller and Tukey [6] have recently made a graphical application of a transformation related to the square-root transformation for such purposes, where the use of "binomial probability paper" avoids all computation. We report here on an empirical study of a number of approximations, some intended for significance and confidence work and others for variance stabilization. For significance testing and the setting of confidence limits, we should like to use the normal deviate K exceeded with the same probability as the number of successes x from n in a binomial distribution with expectation np, which is defined by \${\textbackslash}frac{1}{2{\textbackslash}pi} {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}K\_{-{\textbackslash}infty} e{\textasciicircum}{-{\textbackslash}frac{1}{2}t{\textasciicircum}2} dt = {\textbackslash}{operatorname{Prob}} {\textbackslash}{x {\textbackslash}leq k {\textbar}mid {\textbackslash}operatorname{binomial}, n, p{\textbackslash}}.\$ The most useful approximations to K that we can propose here are N (very simple), N+ (accurate near the usual percentage points), and N** (quite accurate generally), where {\$N} = 2 ({\textbackslash}sqrt{(k + 1)q} - {\textbackslash}sqrt{(n - k)p)}.\$ {(This} is the approximation used with binomial probability paper.) {\$N{\textasciicircum}+} = N + {\textbackslash}{frac{N} + 2p - 1}{12{\textbackslash}{sqrt{E}}},{\textbackslash}quad E = {\textbackslash}text{lesser of} np {\textbackslash}text{and} nq, N{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast = N + {\textbackslash}{frac{(N} - {2)(N} + 2)}{12} {\textbackslash}big({\textbackslash}frac{1}{{\textbackslash}sqrt{np + 1}} - {\textbackslash}frac{1}{{\textbackslash}sqrt{nq + 1}}{\textbackslash}big), N{\textasciicircum}{{\textbackslash}ast{\textbackslash}ast} = N{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast + {\textbackslash}{frac{N{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast} + 2p - 1}{12 {\textbackslash}{sqrt{E}}{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}quad} E = {\textbackslash}text{lesser of} np {\textbackslash}text{and} nq.\$ For variance stabilization, the averaged angular transformation \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}{-1}{\textbackslash}sqrt{{\textbackslash}frac{x}{n + 1}} + {\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}{-1} {\textbackslash}sqrt{{\textbackslash}frac{x + 1}{n+1}}\$ has variance within ± 6\% of 1/n + 1/2 (angles in radians), 821/n + 1/2 (angles in degrees), for almost all cases where np ≥ 1.

Included is a Java haplotype, specimens of which were used to first describe V. jacobsoni at the beginning of this century. A new name, V. destructor n. sp., is given to six haplotypes that infest A. cerana on mainland Asia. Adult females of V. destructor are significantly larger and less spherical in shape than females of V. jacobsoni and they are also reproductively isolated from females of V. jacobsoni .

The most common species, T. clareae , is also an economically important pest of the introduced Western honeybee ( A. mellifera ) throughout Asia and is considered an emerging threat to world apiculture. In the studies reported here, genetic {(mtDNA} {CO-I} and nuclear {ITS1-5.8S-ITS2} gene sequence) and morphological variation and host associations were examined among Tropilaelaps isolates collected from A. dorsata , A. laboriosa and A. mellifera throughout Asia and neighbouring regions.

Tropilaelaps clareae , previously assumed to be ubiquitous in Asia, was found to be two species, and it is here redefined as encompassing haplotypes (mites with distinct {mtDNA} gene sequences) that parasitise native A. dorsata breviligula and introduced A. mellifera in the Philippines and also native A. d. binghami on Sulawesi Island in Indonesia. Tropilaelaps mercedesae n. sp., which until now has been mistaken for T. clareae , encompasses haplotypes that, together with haplotypes of T. koenigerum , parasitise native A. d. dorsata in mainland Asia and Indonesia (except Sulawesi Island). It also parasitises introduced A. mellifera in these and surrounding regions and, with another new species, T. thaii n. sp., also parasitises A. laboriosa in mountainous Himalayan regions. Methods are described for identifying each species.

Two components of sample variation were simulated: selecting hosts from the general population which was modelled by the negative binomial distribution {(NBD)}, and taking an aliquot of faeces from the selected host to estimate the worm egg count by assuming a Poisson distribution of sample counts. Geometric mean counts were determined by adding a constant {(C)} to each count prior to log transformation, C was set at 25, 12 or 1. Ten thousand Monte Carlo simulations were run to estimate mean efficacy, the 2.5\% (lower) and the 97.5\% (upper) percentile based on arithmetic or geometric means. Arithmetic means best estimated efficacy for all different levels of worm aggregation. For moderate levels of aggregation and with C\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;1 the geometric mean substantially overestimated efficacy. The bias was reduced if C was increased to 25 but the results were no better than those based on arithmetic means. For very high levels of aggregation (over-dispersed populations) the geometric mean underestimated efficacy regardless of the size of C. It is recommended that the guidelines on anthelmintic resistance be revised to advocate the use of arithmetic means to estimate efficacy.},

	abstract = {Anthelmintic resistant cattle nematodes have been reported in different regions around the world. However, in Western Europe the assessment of the problem relies largely on case reports and no prevalence data based on wide-scale surveys are available. Therefore, we performed a survey to (1) screen for reduced anthelmintic efficacy in Belgian and German cattle farms; (2) evaluate the usefulness of a simplified faecal egg count reduction test {(FECRT)}, where efficacies are based on the mean {FECs} of 10 at random collected faecal samples pre- and post-treatment per farm and (3) identify possible risk factors for reduced anthelmintic efficacy.

Of 88 farms included in this study, 84 farms used macrocyclic lactones {(MLs).} A {FECR} \&lt;95\% was observed on 39\% of these 84 farms. However, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation analysis, to correct for the used {McMaster} {FEC} technique with a detection limit of 50\&\#xa0;epg, reduced efficacy could only be confirmed in 25\% of the farms (21/84). Only Cooperia spp. were found in significant numbers in the coprocultures post-treatment. Reduced efficacy was significantly associated with farm type and with a lower efficacy in beef herds compared to dairy herds. Four farms were revisited and a standardized {FECRT} was performed to confirm anthelmintic resistance {(AR).} Surprisingly, macrocyclic lactone resistance against Cooperia oncophora was only confirmed in one of four farms. In conclusion, our results show that a reduced efficacy observed in a {FECRT} are not only caused by {AR} but that the detection limit of the {FEC} technique used and the (in)correct administration of the anthelmintic drugs are confounding factors of major importance.},

	abstract = {The process of domestication often brings about profound changes in levels of genetic variation in animals and plants. The honey bee, Apis mellifera, has been managed by humans for centuries for both honey and wax production and crop pollination. Human management and selective breeding are believed to have caused reductions in genetic diversity in honey bee populations, thereby contributing to the global declines threatening this ecologically and economically important insect. However, previous studies supporting this claim mostly relied on population genetic comparisons of European and African (or Africanized) honey bee races; such conclusions require reassessment given recent evidence demonstrating that the honey bee originated in Africa and colonized Europe via two independent expansions. We sampled honey bee workers from two managed populations in North America and Europe as well as several old-world progenitor populations in Africa, East and West Europe. Managed bees had highly introgressed genomes representing admixture between East and West European progenitor populations. We found that managed honey bees actually have higher levels of genetic diversity compared with their progenitors in East and West Europe, providing an unusual example whereby human management increases genetic diversity by promoting admixture. The relationship between genetic diversity and honey bee declines is tenuous given that managed bees have more genetic diversity than their progenitors and many viable domesticated animals.},

	abstract = {Abstract {AIM:} To use a simulation model of the spread of the Asian honeybee mite {(Varroa} destructor) amongst apiaries, to evaluate a series of detection surveillance programmes for the South Island of New Zealand. {METHODS:} Five potential incursion sites into the South Island were selected. A stochastic spatial simulation model, Varroa\_sim, was adapted to simulate spread of the mite from these sites as a series of silent-phase propagating epidemics. The study population comprised all apiaries in the South Island registered in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's {(MAF's)} apiary database in 2003. Six different surveillance programmes were simulated to try and detect the mite. Three of these were the actual multi-stage sampling plans conducted during the autumn {(March?May)} of 2001, 2002 and 2003, and the other three involved simple random sampling with sampling fractions equivalent to the actual numbers of apiaries tested in each of those years. The relative performances of the different surveillance plans were evaluated in terms of their ability to detect the mite early before it had spread too far and whilst there might still be a chance of eradication. {RESULTS:} There were 13,798 registered apiaries in the South Island with valid map coordinates in the apiary database at the time of the study. The model generated 50 epidemics against which the various surveillance programmes were evaluated. The actual surveillance programmes conducted during the autumn of 2001 and 2002 generally performed fairly well in detecting the mite. The programme conducted in autumn 2003 detected the mite reasonably well in high-risk areas, but was very poor in low-risk areas. The simple random sampling strategies performed surprisingly well, and their relative rankings were proportional to the sampling fractions employed. {CONCLUSIONS:} This study showed the value in using a spatial simulation model to generate plausible silent-phase epidemics, against which detection surveillance programmes could be evaluated, in ways that would otherwise not be possible.},

As an extreme form of colony defense, self-sacrificial behaviors have evolved by kin selection in various social insects. Most self-sacrificial defensive mechanisms occur in response to an acute threat to the colony, but some behaviors are preemptive actions that avert harm to the colony. Self-sacrifice has also been observed as a form of preemptive defense against parasites and pathogens where individuals will abandon their normal colony function and die in self-exile to reduce the risk of infecting nestmates. Here, we provide an overview of the self-destructive defense mechanisms that eusocial insects have evolved and discuss avenues for future research into this form of altruism.},

Methods and Results: Nosema spp. were quantified using duplex quantitative real-time {PCR} in the thoracic salivary, hypopharyngeal, mandibular glands, and venom sac and glands of A. mellifera over a period of 8 months. Both Nosema species were present in all the glands as single or mixed species; however, N. apis was not present as single-species detections in the salivary glands (see Table 2). Nosema ceranae was more prevalent throughout the 8 months. Significant correlative relationships were established for N. ceranae and N. apis levels in the honeybee glands and those found within the intestines of forager honeybees. Overall, the seasonality of N. ceranae and N. apis in the different glands tightly followed the seasonal patterns in the honeybee guts.
Conclusions: Nosema ceranae and N. apis are not tissue specific, and honeybee glands have potential to become a useful indicator of the extent of disease in the colony and may represent a potential infection reservoir.
Significance and Impact of the Study:  First report of spore load quantification of Nosema spp. in different honeybee glands.},

	abstract = {The microsporidium Nosema ceranae is a newly prevalent parasite of the European honey bee {(Apis} mellifera). Although this parasite is presently spreading across the world into its novel host, the mechanisms by it which affects the bees and how bees respond are not well understood. We therefore performed an extensive characterization of the parasite effects at the molecular level by using genetic and biochemical tools. The transcriptome modifications at the midgut level were characterized seven days post-infection with tiling microarrays. Then we tested the bee midgut response to infection by measuring activity of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes (superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase). At the gene-expression level, the bee midgut responded to N. ceranae infection by an increase in oxidative stress concurrent with the generation of antioxidant enzymes, defense and protective response specifically observed in the gut of mammals and insects. However, at the enzymatic level, the protective response was not confirmed, with only glutathione-S-transferase exhibiting a higher activity in infected bees. The oxidative stress was associated with a higher transcription of sugar transporter in the gut. Finally, a dramatic effect of the microsporidia infection was the inhibition of genes involved in the homeostasis and renewal of intestinal tissues {(Wnt} signaling pathway), a phenomenon that was confirmed at the histological level. This tissue degeneration and prevention of gut epithelium renewal may explain early bee death. In conclusion, our integrated approach not only gives new insights into the pathological effects of N. ceranae and the bee gut response, but also demonstrate that the honey bee gut is an interesting model system for studying host defense responses.},

However, the molecular interactions between infected larvae and P. larvae are poorly understood and little more than speculation exist concerning virulence factors. Recently, a putative S-layer protein has been identified in P. larvae. We here demonstrate that only representatives of P. larvae genotype {ERIC} {II} harbor a functional {splA-gene} and that {SplA} is a true S-layer protein with self-assembly capability. The presence of a functional S-layer protein is novel for P. larvae. When elucidating the biological function of {SplA} we broke new ground by establishing primary cell culture for pupal gut cells and by developing a genetic system for disruption of gene expression in this important honey bee pathogen. By using these novel methods we were able to prove that {SplA} serves as a shape-determining factor, mediates adhesion to host cells, and is a key virulence factor of P. larvae {ERIC} {II.} These results present an immense advancement in our understanding of P. larvae pathogenesis. Furthermore, we propose P. larvae as a model system for the analysis of the in vivo functions of S-layer proteins because P. larvae {SlpA} knockout-mutants retain viability and are thus suitable for functional studies.},

	abstract = {The effect of using acaricides to control varroa mites has long been a concern to the beekeeping industry due to unintended negative impacts on honey bee health. Irregular ontogenesis, suppression of immune defenses, and impairment of normal behavior have been linked to pesticide use. External stressors, including parasites and the pathogens they vector, can confound studies on the effects of pesticides on the metabolism of honey bees. This is the case of Varroa destructor, a mite that negatively affects honey bee health on many levels, from direct parasitism, which diminishes honey bee productivity, to vectoring and/or activating other pathogens, including many viruses. Here we present a gene expression profile comprising genes acting on diverse metabolic levels (detoxification, immunity, and development) in a honey bee population that lacks the influence of varroa mites. We present data for hives treated with five different acaricides; Apiguard (thymol), Apistan (tau-fluvalinate), Checkmite (coumaphos), Miteaway (formic acid) and {ApiVar} (amitraz). The results indicate that thymol, coumaphos and formic acid are able to alter some metabolic responses. These include detoxification gene expression pathways, components of the immune system responsible for cellular response and the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase {(JNK)} pathway, and developmental genes. These could potentially interfere with the health of individual honey bees and entire colonies.},

	abstract = {As it has been 30 years since a new anthelmintic class was released, it is appropriate to review management practices aimed at slowing the development of anthelmintic resistance to all drug classes. Recommendations to delay anthelmintic resistance, provide refugia and the use of a simulation model were reviewed to find optimum treatment strategies that maintain nematode control. Simulated Australian conditions indicated that a common successful low-risk treatment program was a rapid rotation between a “triple-combination” product (benzimidazole\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;levamisole\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;abamectin) and a new high-efficacy drug (monepantel). Where Haemonchus contortus was a threat, moxidectin was required at critical times because of its persistent activity against this parasite. Leaving up to 4\% of adult sheep untreated provided sufficient “refugia” for non-selected worms to reduce the risk of selecting for anthelmintic resistance without compromising nematode control.

For a new anthelmintic, efficacy estimated by faecal egg count reduction {(FECR)} is likely to be at or close to 100\%, however using current methods the 95\% confidence limits {(CL)} for 100\% are incorrectly determined as 100\%. The fewer eggs counted pre-treatment, the more likely an estimate of 100\% will occur, particularly if the true efficacy is \&gt;90\%. A novel way to determine the lower-{CL} {(LCL)} for 100\% efficacy is to reframe {FECR} as a binomial proportion, i.e. define: n and x as the total number of eggs counted (rather than eggs per gram of faeces) for all pre-treatment and post-treatment animals, respectively; p the proportion of resistant eggs is p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;x/n and percent efficacy is 100\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;(1\&\#xa0;−\&\#xa0;p) (assuming equal treatment group sizes and detection levels, pre- and post-treatment). The {LCL} is approximated from the cumulative inverse beta distribution by: {95\%LCL\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;100\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;(1\&\#xa0;−\&\#xa0;(BETAINV(0.975}, x\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;1, n\&\#xa0;−\&\#xa0;x\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;1))). This method is simpler than the current method, independent of the number of animals tested, and demonstrates that for 100\% efficacy at least 37 eggs (not eggs per gram) need to be counted pre-treatment before the {LCL} can exceed 90\%. When nematode aggregation is high, this method can be usefully applied to efficacy estimates lower than 100\%, and in this case the 95\% upper-{CL} {(UCL)} can be estimated by:

{95\%UCL\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;100\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;(1\&\#xa0;(\&\#xa0;(BETAINV(0.025}, x\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;1, n\&\#xa0;−\&\#xa0;x\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;1))), with the {LCL} approximated as described above. A simulation study to estimate the precision and accuracy of this method found that the more conservative {99\%CL} was optimum; in this case 0.975 and 0.025 are replaced by 0.995 and 0.005 to estimate the {LCL} and {UCL}, respectively.},

	abstract = {The faecal egg count reduction test {(FECRT)} is the method of choice to monitor anthelmintic efficacy against gastro-intestinal nematodes in livestock. Guidelines on how to conduct a {FECRT} are made available by the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology {(WAAVP).} Since the publication of these guidelines in the early 1990s, some limitations have been noted, including (i) the ignorance of host–parasite interactions that depend on animal and parasite species, (ii) their feasibility under field conditions, (iii) appropriateness of study design, and (iv) the high detection limit of the recommended faecal egg count {(FEC)} method. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to empirically assess the impact of the level of excretion and aggregation of {FEC}, sample size and detection limit of the {FEC} method on the sensitivity and specificity of the {FECRT} to detect reduced efficacy (\&lt;90\% or \&lt;95\%) and to develop recommendations for surveys on anthelmintic resistance. A simulation study was performed in which the {FECRT} (based on the arithmetic mean of grouped {FEC} of the same animals before and after drug administration) was conducted under varying conditions of mean {FEC}, aggregation of {FEC} (inversely correlated with k), sample size, detection limit and ‘true’ drug efficacies. Classification trees were built to explore the impact of the above factors on the sensitivity and specificity of detecting a truly reduced efficacy. For a reduced-efficacy threshold of 90\%, most combinations resulted in a reliable detection of reduced and normal efficacy. For the reduced-efficacy threshold of 95\% however, unreliable {FECRT} results were found when sample sizes \&lt;15 were combined with highly aggregated {FEC} (k\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.25) and detection limits ≥5 {EPG} or when combined with detection limits ≥15 {EPG.} Overall, an increase in sample size and mean {preDA} {FEC}, and a decrease in detection limit improved the diagnostic accuracy. {FECRT} remained inconclusive under any evaluated condition for drug efficacies ranging from 87.5\% to 92.5\% for a reduced-efficacy-threshold of 90\% and from 92.5\% to 97.5\% for a threshold of 95\%. The results highlight that (i) the interpretation of this {FECRT} is affected by a complex interplay of factors, including the level of excretion and aggregation of {FEC} and (ii) the diagnostic value of {FECRT} to detect small reductions in efficacy is limited. This study, therefore, provides a framework allowing researchers to adapt their study design according to a wide range of field conditions, while ensuring a good diagnostic performance of the {FECRT.}},

	abstract = {Faecal Egg Count Reduction Tests {(FECRTs)} for macrocyclic lactone {(ML)} and levamisole {(LEV)} drenches were conducted on two dairy farms in the subtropical, summer rainfall region of eastern Australia to determine if anthelmintic failure contributed to severe gastrointestinal nematode infections observed in weaner calves.

Subtropical Cooperia spp. were the dominant nematodes on both farms although significant numbers of Haemonchus placei were also present on Farm 2.

On Farm 1, moxidectin pour-on {(MXD)} drenched at 0.5\&\#xa0;mg\&\#xa0;kg−1 liveweight {(LW)} reduced the overall Cooperia burden by 82\% (95\% confidence limits, 37–95\%) at day 7 post-drench. As worm burdens increased rapidly in younger animals in the control group (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;4), levamisole was used as a salvage drench and these calves withdrawn from the trial on animal welfare grounds after sample collection at day 7. Levamisole {(LEV)} dosed at 6.8\&\#xa0;mg {kg−1\&\#xa0;LW} reduced the worm burden in these calves by 100\%, 7 days after drenching.

On Farm 2, {MXD} given at {0.5\&\#xa0;mg\&\#xa0;kg−1\&\#xa0;LW} reduced the faecal worm egg count of cooperioids at day 8 by 96\% (71–99\%), ivermectin oral {(IVM)} at {0.2\&\#xa0;mg\&\#xa0;kg−1\&\#xa0;LW} by 1.6\% (−224 to 70\%) and {LEV} oral at {7.1\&\#xa0;mg\&\#xa0;kg−1\&\#xa0;LW} by 100\%. For H. placei the reductions were 98\% (85–99.7\%) for {MXD}, 0.7\% (−226 to 70\%) for {IVM} and 100\% for {LEV.}

Since these large-scale interventions are likely to intensify, monitoring of drug efficacy has become a key issue in order to detect the emergence of resistance. At present, the drop in infection intensity is under examination for monitoring the drug efficacy. However, studies comparing detection techniques based on infection intensities are scarce. Moreover, little attention has been addressed to their feasibility and their ability to estimate drug efficacies. We have compared different techniques for the detection of whipworm {(Trichuris)} in simian stool samples based on prevalence, infection intensities, feasibility and ability to estimate the ‘true’ drug efficacy. We have found that techniques often fail to detect low infection intensities and that not all techniques are appropriate for estimating infection intensities. The time needed to obtain a test result varied from 3.9 to 17.7 min/sample. Finally, accurate estimates of drug efficacy were only obtained in high pre-drug administration infection intensities. To conclude, along with accurate estimates of infection intensities, feasibility is a considerable criterion for the detection techniques used in drug efficacy monitoring programs.},

Among the insecticides, the most used in the control of insect pragues has as active agent the pyriproxyfen, analogous to the juvenile hormone {(JH).} Unfortunately the insecticides used in agriculture affect not only the target insects but also beneficial nontarget ones as bees compromising therefore, the growth rate of their colonies at the boundaries of crop fields. Workers that forage for provisions in contaminated areas can introduce contaminated pollen or/and nectar inside the beehives. As analogous to {JH} the insecticide pyriproxyfen acts in the bee's larval growth and differentiation during pupation or metamorphosis timing. The flighty muscle is not present in the larvae wingless organisms, but differentiates during pupation/metamorphosis. This work aimed to investigate the effect of pyriproxyfen insecticide on differentiation of such musculature in workers of Brazilian africanized honey bees fed with artificial diet containing the pesticide. The results show that the bees fed with contaminated diet, independent of the insecticide concentration used, show a delay in flight muscle differentiation when compared to the control. Microsc. Res.

Honey can be contaminated by spores of both species and it has been reported as a suitable matrix to study the field prevalence of other honey bee sporulated pathogens. Historical honey sample collections from the {CAR} laboratory {(Centro} Apícola Regional) were analyzed by {PCR} to identify the earliest instance of emergence, and to determine whether the presence of Nosema spp. in honey was linked to the spread of these microsporidia in honey bee apiaries. A total of 240 frozen honey samples were analyzed by {PCR} and the results compared with rates of Nosema spp. infection in worker bee samples from different years and geographical areas. The presence of Nosema spp. in hive-stored honey from naturally infected honey bee colonies (from an experimental apiary) was also monitored, and although collected honey bees resulted in a more suitable sample to study the presence of microsporidian parasites in the colonies, a high probability of finding Nosema spp. in their hive-stored honey was observed. The first honey sample in which N. ceranae was detected dates back to the year 2000. In subsequent years, the number of samples containing N. ceranae tended to increase, as did the detection of Nosema spp. in adult worker bees. The presence of N. ceranae as early as 2000, long before generalized bee depopulation and colony losses in 2004 may be consistent with a long incubation period for nosemosis type C or related with other unknown factors. The current prevalence of nosemosis, primarily due to N. ceranae, has reached epidemic levels in Spain as confirmed by the analysis of worker honey bees and commercial honey.},

(2010) (upper limit of {95\%CI} \&lt;95\%). There was no significant difference in bias and accuracy of {FECRT} results across the three methods. {FLOTAC} provided the most precise {FECRT} results. Cornell-Wisconsin and {McMaster} gave similar imprecise results. {FECRT} were significantly underestimated when baseline {FEC} were low and drugs were more efficacious. For all {FEC} methods, precision and accuracy of the {FECRT} improved as egg excretion increased, this effect was greatest for {McMaster} and least for Cornell-Wisconsin. The sensitivity of the three methods to detect a truly reduced efficacy was high (\&gt;90\%). Yet, the sensitivity of {McMaster} and Cornell-Wisconsin may drop when drugs only show sub-optimal efficacy. Overall, the study indicates that the precision of {FECRT} is affected by the methodology of {FEC}, and that the level of egg excretion should be considered in the final interpretation of the {FECRT.} However, more comprehensive studies are required to provide more insights into the complex interplay of factors inherent to study design (sample size and {FEC} method) and host-parasite interactions (level of egg excretion and aggregation across the host population).},

In wastewater, which is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, biotic or abiotic degradation of contaminants can be affected by the presence of co-solutes. The photodecomposition in natural sunlight of two neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, was investigated in wastewater, aqueous extracts of sewage sludge and in aqueous surfactant solutions, which are abundant in wastewater. Dissipation in the dark was also studied in wastewater, due to reduction of transmitted sunlight in wastewater ponds. With regard to photolysis, thiamethoxam degraded rapidly in all the aqueous solutions. Among them sewage sludge extracts slightly modified (average half-life 17.6\&\#xa0;h), wastewater increased (13.7\&\#xa0;h) and non-ionic surfactants led, as a family, to the highest dissipation rates (average 6.2\&\#xa0;h), with respect to control water (18.7\&\#xa0;h). Additionally this pesticide also underwent a slower biodegradation process in wastewater in the dark under anaerobic conditions (around 25\&\#xa0;d). A metabolite of thiamethoxam from the biological decomposition in wastewater was identified by {HPLC/MS.} On the other hand thiacloprid was found to be resistant to photo- and biodecomposition and remained almost unchanged during the experimental periods in all the tested media.},

The nitro-substituted compounds were the most toxic to the honey bee in our laboratory studies with {LD50} values of 18\&\#xa0;ng/bee for imidacloprid, 22\&\#xa0;ng for clothianidin, 30\&\#xa0;ng for thiamethoxam, 75\&\#xa0;ng for dinotefuran and 138\&\#xa0;ng for nitenpyram. The cyano-substituted neonicotinoids exhibited a much lower toxicity with {LD50} values for acetamiprid and thiacloprid of 7.1 and 14.6\&\#xa0;μg/bee, respectively. Piperonyl butoxide, triflumizole and propiconazole increased honey bee toxicity of acetamiprid 6.0-, 244- and 105-fold and thiacloprid 154-, 1,141- and 559-fold, respectively, but had a minimal effect on imidacloprid (1.70, 1.85 and 1.52-fold, respectively). The acetamiprid metabolites, N-demethyl acetamiprid, 6-chloro-3-pyridylmethanol and 6-chloro-nicotinic acid when applied topically, produced no mortality at 50\&\#xa0;μg/bee. These results suggest that P450s are an important mechanism for acetamiprid and thiacloprid detoxification and their low toxicity to honey bees. When honey bees were placed in cages in forced contact with alfalfa treated with acetamiprid and the synergist, triflumizole, in combination at their maximum recommended application rates, no mortality was detected above that of the control.},

	abstract = {Honey bees {(Apis} mellifera L.) bred for Varroa sensitive hygiene {(VSH)} selectively remove pupae infested with Varroa destructor Anderson \& Trueman {(Mesostigmata:} Varroidae) from capped brood that is inserted into the nest. After 1 wk, remaining brood cells tend to have been uncapped and recapped, and remaining mites are mostly infertile. A primary goal of this experiment was to compare the reproductive status of mites that remained in recapped and normally capped cells after a 1-wk exposure to {VSH} and control colonies. Differences in distribution of fertile mites in normally capped brood cells between {VSH} bees and control bees may suggest that the stimulus for hygiene is related to reproduction by mites. Identification of stimuli triggering {VSH} behavior could be used to develop new bioassays for selective breeding of this important resistance mechanism. Combs of capped brood that were exposed to control bees had 10 times more pupae with fertile mites in normally capped brood as did {VSH} bees (6.7 and 0.7\%, respectively). They also had 3 times more pupae with infertile mites in normally capped brood than did {VSH} bees (1.4 and 0.5\%, respectively). Thus, {VSH} bees targeted fertile mites by a 3:1 ratio by either removing or uncapping and recapping their host pupae. Biased removal of mite-infested pupae with fertile mites suggested that stimuli triggering {VSH} behavior were enhanced by the presence of mite offspring within the brood cell. This bias for fertile mites is not seen during experiments of short 3-h duration. The differing results are discussed relative to a behavioral threshold model for hygienic behavior in honey bees in which different experimental protocols may reflect activities of honey bees having different sensitivities to pupae infested by fertile mites. In addition, mortality of mite offspring was significantly higher in recapped cells than in normally capped cells and contributed to decreased reproduction by the mites.},

(honeybees, thiamethoxam) and Whitehorn et al., (bumblebees, imidacloprid) published in Science (2012) with exposure of bees, following the actual use of these neonicotinoids. A third study investigating sub-lethal effects on honeybees for clothianidin and imidacloprid was also considered {(Schneider} et al., 2012). Data of uses authorised in {EU} and data on residues in pollen and nectar were collected to compare the actual exposure of bees with the investigated doses. The residue data were limited and available only for some crops; therefore, the extrapolation to other crops was not considered appropriate. In the studies on honeybees, the highest residue levels of thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid in nectar were compared with the actual concentrations tested. The results indicated that the tested concentrations were higher than the concentrations found in nectar. The residue intake was estimated using different exposure scenarios. The results indicated that the doses tested in these publications were lower for clothianidin and for thiamethoxam than the estimated exposure. For imidacloprid the doses tested were higher in all the scenarios. In the studies on honeybees, the total amount of active substance was consumed by honeybees within a relatively short period instead of being not administrated over a longer period i.e a day. In the study on bumblebees the tested concentrations were in the range of the highest residues of imidacloprid in pollen and nectar. However, the relevance of the exposure period in the study is unknown. The comparison between the doses tested in the studies with the actual doses with the exposure of bees was considered feasible only for the seed treatment uses to maize, sunflower, oilseed rape and alfalfa. Further data would be necessary before drawing a definite conclusion on the behavioural effects regarding sub-lethal exposure of foragers exposed to actual doses of neonicotinoids},

	abstract = {Honeybees are of capital importance for humans since crop production significantly depends upon pollination by these insects. In recent years, widespread collapses of honeybee colonies have been reported throughout the world; unfortunately, despite intense research efforts, the causal agents of such losses are not yet identified, although parasites seem to play a key-role. We combined molecular, field-longitudinal and theoretical approaches to describe the mechanistic basis and dynamical properties of collapse-causing interactions within the multi-parasite community infecting the honeybees. We found that the parasitic mite Varroa destructor can de-stabilise the within-host dynamics of Deformed wing virus {(DWV)}, transforming a cryptic and vertically transmitted virus into a rapidly replicating killer. The de-stabilisation of {DWV} infection results from a widespread immunosuppression characterized by a strong down-regulation of a member of the gene family {NF-κB.} This gene family not only plays a central role in insect immunity, but is also involved in intricate cross-talks with a number of physiological and stress response pathways. This suggests that different stress factors may alter the critical balance between viral pathogens and host-defences, promoting intense viral replication in bees harbouring silent infections and subsequent colony collapse. The model we propose can potentially explain the multifactorial origin of bee losses.},

	abstract = {Honey bee societies {(Apis} mellifera), the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, and honey bee viruses that are vectored by the mite, form a complex system of host–parasite interactions. Coevolution by natural selection in this system has been hindered for European honey bee hosts since apicultural practices remove the mite and consequently the selective pressures required for such a process. An increasing mite population means increasing transmission opportunities for viruses that can quickly develop into severe infections, killing a bee colony. Remarkably, a few subpopulations in Europe have survived mite infestation for extended periods of over 10 years without management by beekeepers and offer the possibility to study their natural host–parasite coevolution. Our study shows that two of these “natural” honey bee populations, in Avignon, France and Gotland, Sweden, have in fact evolved resistant traits that reduce the fitness of the mite (measured as the reproductive success), thereby reducing the parasitic load within the colony to evade the development of overt viral infections. Mite reproductive success was reduced by about 30\% in both populations. Detailed examinations of mite reproductive parameters suggest these geographically and genetically distinct populations favor different mechanisms of resistance, even though they have experienced similar selection pressures of mite infestation. Compared to unrelated control colonies in the same location, mites in the Avignon population had high levels of infertility while in Gotland there was a higher proportions of mites that delayed initiation of egg-laying. Possible explanations for the observed rapid coevolution are discussed.},

In order to reproduce varroa females enter worker or drone brood shortly before the cell is sealed. From March to December 2008, the reproductive rate and offspring mortality (mature and immature stages), focusing on male absence and male mortality of V. destructor , was investigated in naturally infested worker and drone brood of Africanized honey bees {(AHB)} in Costa Rica. Data were obtained from 388 to 403 single infested worker and drone brood cells, respectively. Mite fertility in worker and drone brood cells was 88.9 and 93.1\%, respectively. There was no difference between the groups {(X} 2 = 3.6, P = 0.06). However, one of the most significant differences in mite reproduction was the higher percentage of mites producing viable offspring in drone cells (64.8\%) compared to worker cells (37.6\%) {(X} 2 = 57.2, P \&lt; 0.05). A greater proportion of mites in worker brood cells produced non-viable female offspring. Mite offspring mortality in both worker and drone cells was high in the protonymph stage (mobile and immobile). A significant finding was the high rate of male mortality. The worker and drone brood revealed that 23.9 and 6.9\%, respectively, of the adult male offspring was found dead. If the absence (missing) of the male and adult male mortality are taken together the percentage of cells increased to 40.0 and 21.3\% in worker and drone cells, respectively {(X} 2 = 28.8, P \&lt; 0.05). The absence of the male or male mortality in a considerable number of worker cells naturally infested with varroa is the major factor in our study which reduces the production of viable daughters in {AHB} colonies in Costa Rica.},

	abstract = {Movements of the parasitic honey bee mite, Varroa jacobsoni {(Oud.)} were monitored in several assays as they moved among adult host honey bees, Apis mellifera . We examined the propensity of mites to leave their hosts and to move onto new bee hosts. We also examined their preference for bees of different age and hive function. Mites were standardized by selecting mites from newly emerged worker bees {(NEWs).} In closed jars, 50\% of Varroa left {NEWs} irreversibly when no physical path was present for the mites to return to the {NEWs;} about 90\% of mites left newly emerged drones in identical assays. In petri dish arenas, mites were rarely seen off {NEW} hosts when monitored at 15-min intervals for 4 h; this was the case for single {NEWs} with one mite {(NEWs+)} and when a {NEW+} and a {NEW−} (no mites) were placed together in a petri dish. When a {NEW+} was held with either a nurse bee or a pollen forager, 25\% of the mites moved to the older bees. When both a nurse and a pollen forager were placed in a petri dish with a {NEW+}, about 50\% of the mites transferred to older bees; nurse bees received about 80\% of these mites, whereas pollen foragers received significantly fewer mites (about 20\%, P \&lt; 0.05). Most mite transfers occurred during the first 30 min after combining {NEWs+} and test bees. When {NEWs+} were combined with bees of known ages, rather than function, mites transferred more often to young bees than to older bees (1- and 5-day-old bees vs. 25-day-old bees, P \&lt; 0.05; 1-day-old vs. 13- and 25-day-old bees; P \&lt; 0.05). No differences in proportions of transferring mites were seen when the range of bee ages was ≤ 8 days ( P \&gt; 0.05), implying that the factors mediating the mites’ adult-host preference change gradually with bee age. A possible chemical basis for host choice by Varroa is indicated by their greater propensity to move onto freezer-killed nurse bees than onto freezer-killed pollen foragers ( P \&lt; 0.05) and by their lower movement onto heat-treated bees than onto control bees ( P \&lt; 0.05). Bee age, hive function, and directional changes in cuticular chemistry are all correlated. Movements of newly emerged mites in relation to these variables may provide insights into their reproductive success in Apis mellifera colonies.},

	abstract = {Recent losses in honey bee colonies are unusual in their severity, geographical distribution, and, in some cases, failure to present recognized characteristics of known disease. Domesticated honey bees face numerous pests and pathogens, tempting hypotheses that colony collapses arise from exposure to new or resurgent pathogens. Here we explore the incidence and abundance of currently known honey bee pathogens in colonies suffering from Colony Collapse Disorder {(CCD)}, otherwise weak colonies, and strong colonies from across the United States. Although pathogen identities differed between the eastern and western United States, there was a greater incidence and abundance of pathogens in {CCD} colonies. Pathogen loads were highly covariant in {CCD} but not control hives, suggesting that {CCD} colonies rapidly become susceptible to a diverse set of pathogens, or that co-infections can act synergistically to produce the rapid depletion of workers that characterizes the disorder. We also tested workers from a {CCD-free} apiary to confirm that significant positive correlations among pathogen loads can develop at the level of individual bees and not merely as a secondary effect of {CCD.} This observation and other recent data highlight pathogen interactions as important components of bee disease. Finally, we used deep {RNA} sequencing to further characterize microbial diversity in {CCD} and non-{CCD} hives. We identified novel strains of the recently described Lake Sinai viruses {(LSV)} and found evidence of a shift in gut bacterial composition that may be a biomarker of {CCD.} The results are discussed with respect to host-parasite interactions and other environmental stressors of honey bees.},

Other Nosema species, such as N. apis, tend to be associated with increased defecation and spread via a fecal-oral pathway, but because N. ceranae does not induce defecation, it may instead be spread via an oral-oral pathway. Cages that separated older infected bees from young uninfected bees were used to test whether N. ceranae can be spread during food exchange. When cages were separated by one screen, food could be passed between the older bees and the young bees, but when separated by two screens, food could not be passed between the two cages. Young uninfected bees were also kept isolated in cages, as a solitary control. After 4 days of exposure to the older bees, and 10 days to incubate infections, young bees were more likely to be infected in the 1-Screen Test treatment vs. the 2-Screen Test treatment {(P} = 0.0097). Young bees fed by older bees showed a 13-fold increase in mean infection level relative to young bees not fed by older bees (1-Screen Test 40.8\%; 2-Screen Test 3.4\%; Solo Control 2.8\%). Although fecal-oral transmission is still possible in this experimental design, oral-oral infectivity could help explain the rapid spread of N. ceranae worldwide.},

	abstract = {Social removal is often an adaptive response for preventing the entry and spread of parasitic infection between kin members of a group. Social isolation via removal or the switching of social tasks has also been observed in insect societies; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We tested in honeybees the role of the immune system in physiological and behavioral modulation. Forager bees are often located in the outer area of the colony, and thus have reduced contacts with individuals of high importance, who are located in the inner area of the colony (e.g. queen and brood). We thus expected that an immune challenge would induce a forager profile. This was confirmed by measuring brain (foraging and malvolio gene expression), physiological (hypopharyngeal glands size) and behavioral (queen attendance) parameters of nurse/forager profiles after a treatment with an immune-activator (lipopolysaccharides). Our results support the idea that the interplay between the brain and immune system may be an important regulatory factor of social immunity in insects.},

The results revealed a greater prevalence than expected in most of the geographical areas studied where has been generally underestimated One problem encountered in this study was to distinguish between A. woodi and other species {(A.} dorsalis and A. externus) at the molecular level.

(2012) show that the domestication of honey bees, rather than reducing genetic variance in the population, has increased it. It seems that the commercial honey bees of Canada are a mongrel lot, with far more variability than their ancestors in Europe.},

We use the honeybee {(Apis} mellifera), a well-established model system for studying learning, to investigate the impact of deformed wing virus {(DWV)} on learning. Injection of {DWV} into the haemolymph of forager leads to a {RT-PCR} detectable {DWV} signal after 3 days. The detailed behavioural analysis of {DWV-infected} honeybees shows an increased responsiveness to water and low sucrose concentrations, an impaired associative learning and memory formation, but intact non-associative learning like sensitization and habituation. This contradicts all present studies in non-infected bees, where increased sucrose responsiveness is linked to improved associative learning and to changes in non-associative learning. Thus, {DWV} seems to interfere with molecular mechanism of learning by yet unknown processes that may include viral effects on the immune system and on gene expression.},

	doi = {10.4039/n05-024},
	abstract = {This study consisted of two field experiments designed to assess the effects of acaricide treatment timing on the mean abundance of the mite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman and its impact on honey production and colony survival in honey bees, Apis mellifera L. {(Hymenoptera:} Apidae). In the first experiment, replicated colonies with different levels of infestation by V. destructor were given one of six treatments: untreated, with a low level of infestation by V. destructor; untreated, with a moderate level of infestation by V. destructor; exposed to fluvalinate for 42 days; exposed to two applications of Perizin®; or exposed to four applications of a pour-on formulation of formic acid at 4- or 10-day intervals. The six treatments were applied in either spring or fall. In experiment two, replicated colonies with a high level of infestation by V. destructor were left untreated, exposed to fluvalinate for 42 days, exposed to five applications of formic acid at 7-day intervals, or exposed to an equivalent amount of formic acid applied as a slow-release formulation. For each experiment, V. destructor densities, measured by alcohol wash, and colony survival were monitored for 1 year, and honey production was assessed in the year in which the spring treatment was applied. The results showed that all of the acaricide treatments were effective in reducing the mean abundance of V. destructor. However, efficacy varied with season. Fluvalinate was effective in controlling varroa under either spring or fall treatment conditions. Fall applications of Perizin® provided better control than spring applications. Formic acid provided consistent control of V. destructor in spring applications, regardless of the interval between treatments or whether pour-on or slow-release formulations were used, but was ineffective in the fall. Honey production was improved by spring acaricide treatments in both years. When the mean abundance of V. destructor was 0.02 ± 0.005 mites per bee (2 mites per 100 bees) in mid-April, honey production increased from 66 ± 17 kg per colony in untreated colonies to up to 116 ± 23 kg per colony in colonies treated with acaricide. When V. destructor levels were 0.21 ± 0.02 mites per bee (21 mites per 100 bees) in mid-May, spring acaricide treatments increased honey production from 1.3 ± 2.3 kg per untreated colony to up to 48 ± 17 kg per acaricide-treated colony. For the prairie region of Canada, producers will need to assess colonies in both spring and fall and treat when the mean abundance of V. destructor is more than 0.02 mites per bee (2 mites per 100 bees) in spring to prevent losses in honey production. Producers should treat when the mite level is greater than 0.04 mites per bee (4 mites per 100 bees) in late August to early September to prevent fall or winter colony loss. In this study, tracheal mite {(Acarapis} woodi {(Rennie))} {(Acari:} Tarsonemidae) levels were very low, so interactions between mites were not studied. If both tracheal and varroa mites are present, lower fall thresholds might be required. In the absence of tracheal mites, colonies with varroa mite levels of more than 0.17 mites per bee (17 mites per 100 bees) in late fall experienced significant winter loss.},

	abstract = {Deformed wing virus {(DWV)} is a honeybee viral pathogen either persisting as an inapparent infection or resulting in wing deformity. The occurrence of deformity is associated with the transmission of {DWV} through Varroa destructor during pupal stages. Such infections with {DWV} add to the pathology of V. destructor and play a major role in colony collapse in the course of varroosis. Using a recently developed {RT-PCR} protocol for the detection of {DWV}, individual bees and mites originating from hives differing in Varroa infestation levels and the occurrence of crippled bees were analysed. It was found that 100 \% of both crippled and asymptomatic bees were positive for {DWV.} However, a significant difference in the spatial distribution of {DWV} between asymptomatic and crippled bees could be demonstrated: when analysing head, thorax and abdomen of crippled bees, all body parts were always strongly positive for viral sequences. In contrast, for asymptomatic bees viral sequences could be detected in {RNA} extracted from the thorax and/or abdomen but never in {RNA} extracted from the head. {DWV} replication was demonstrated in almost all {DWV-positive} body parts of infected bees. Analysing individual mites for the presence of {DWV} revealed that the percentage of {DWV-positive} mites differed between mite populations. In addition, it was demonstrated that {DWV} was able to replicate in some but not all mites. Interestingly, virus replication in mites was correlated with wing deformity. {DWV} was also detected in the larval food, implicating that in addition to transmission by V. destructor {DWV} is also transmitted by feeding.},

The mechanism of how varroa mites kill honey bees remains unclear. We have addressed the effects of the mites on bee immunity and the replication of a picorna-like virus, the deformed wing virus {(DWV).} The expression of genes encoding three antimicrobial peptides (abaecin, defensin, and hymenoptaecin) and four immunity-related enzymes (phenol oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase, glucose oxidase, and lysozyme) were used as markers to measure the difference in the immune response. We have demonstrated an example of an ectoparasite immunosuppressing its invertebrate host with the evidence that parasitization significantly suppressed expression of these immunity-related genes. Given that ticks immunosuppress their vertebrate hosts, our finding indicates that immunosuppression of hosts may be a common phenomenon in the interaction and coevolution between ectoparasites and their vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. {DWV} viral titers were significantly negatively correlated with the expression levels of the immunity-related enzymes. All bees had detectable {DWV.} Mite-infested pupae developed into adults with either normal or deformed wings. All of the deformed-wing bees were greatly infected by {DWV} (≈106 times higher than varroa-infested but normal-winged bees). Injection with heat-killed bacteria dramatically promoted {DWV} titers (105 times in 10 h) in the mite-infested, normal-winged bees to levels similar to those found in mite-infested, deformed-wing bees. Varroa mites may cause the serious demise of honey bees by suppressing bee immunity and by boosting the amplification of {DWV} in bees exposed to microbes.

The virus is associated with wing deformity in symptomatic bees, and premature death and reduced colony performance in asymptomatic bees. In the present study we reduced {DWV} infection by feeding both first instar larvae and adult A. mellifera with a double-stranded (ds) {RNA} construct, {DWV-dsRNA}, which is specific to {DWV} in {DWV-inoculated} bees, by mixing it with their food. We showed that feeding {DWV} to larvae causes wing deformity in adult bees in the absence of varroa mites and decreases survival rates of adult bees relative to bees not fed {DWV.} Feeding larvae with {DWV-dsRNA} in advance of inoculation with virus reduced the {DWV} viral level and reduced wing deformity relative to larvae fed {DWV} or {DWV} with green fluorescent protein-{dsRNA} (probably a result of {RNA} silencing), but did not affect survival to the adult stage. Feeding {DWV-dsRNA} did not affect larval survival rates, which suggests that {dsRNA} is non-toxic to larvae. Feeding adult workers with {DWV-dsRNA} in advance of inoculation with virus increased their longevity and reduced {DWV} concentration relative to controls.},

Insecticides may elicit lethal and sublethal effects of different natures that may affect various biological systems of the honey bee. The first step in the induction of toxicity by a chemical is the interaction between the toxic compound and its molecular target. The action on the molecular target can lead to the induction of observable or non-visible effects. The toxic substance may impair important processes involved in cognitive functions, behaviour or integrity of physiological functions. This review is focused on the neural effects of insecticides that have repercussions on (a) cognitive functions, including learning and memory, habituation, olfaction and gustation, navigation and orientation; (b) behaviour, including foraging and (c) physiological functions, including thermoregulation and muscle activity.},

Samples of paralyzed bees were (i) produced by experimental inoculation with purified virus and (ii) collected from hives exhibiting chronic paralysis. {CBPV} in bee heads or feces (crude or absorbed onto paper) was detected by reverse transcription-{PCR.} {CBPV} infectivity was assessed by intrathoracic inoculation of bees with virus extracted from feces and by placement of naive bees in cages previously occupied by contaminated individuals. {CBPV} {RNA} was systematically detected in the feces of naturally and experimentally infected bees and on the paper sheets that had been used to cover the floors of units containing bees artificially infected with {CBPV} or the floor of one naturally infected colony. Both intrathoracic inoculation of bees with virus extracted from feces and placement of bees in contaminated cages provoked overt disease in naive bees, thereby proving that the excreted virus was infectious and that this indirect route of infection could lead to overt chronic paralysis. This is the first experimental confirmation that infectious {CBPV} particles excreted in the feces of infected bees can infect naive bees and provoke overt disease by mere confinement of naive bees in a soiled environment.},

The coding sequence is flanked by a 1,144-nucleotide 5′ nontranslated leader sequence and a 317-nucleotide 3′ nontranslated region, followed by a {poly(A)} tail. The three major structural proteins, {VP1} (44 {kDa)}, {VP2} (32 {kDa)}, and {VP3} (28 {kDa)}, were identified, and their genes were mapped to the N-terminal section of the polyprotein.

Parasites are known to be an important factor in the some of the population declines of honey bees and bumblebees, but little is known about the parasites afflicting most other pollinators, or the extent of interspecific transmission or vectoring of parasites. Here we carry out a preliminary screening of pollinators (honey bees, five species of bumblebee, three species of wasp, four species of hoverfly and three genera of other bees) in the {UK} for parasites. We used molecular methods to screen for six honey bee viruses, Ascosphaera fungi, Microsporidia, and Wolbachia intracellular bacteria. We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites, encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi, while Microsporidia were rarer, being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia, most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont, and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly, we found that about a third of bumblebees {(Bombus} pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps {(Vespula} vulgaris), as well as all honey bees, were positive for deformed wing virus, but that this virus was not present in other pollinators. Deformed wing virus therefore does not appear to be a general parasite of pollinators, but does interact significantly with at least three species of bumblebee and wasp. Further work is needed to establish the identity of some of the parasites, their spatiotemporal variation, and whether they are infecting the various pollinator species or being vectored. However, these results provide a first insight into the diversity, and potential exchange, of parasites in pollinator communities.},

We collected foundress mites from stages of brood (newly sealed larvae, prepupae, white-eyed pupae, and pink-eyed pupae) and phoretic mites from adult bees. We then inoculated these mites into cells containing newly sealed larvae. Successful reproduction (foundress laid both a mature male and female) was low (13\%) but most common in mites coming from sealed larvae. Unsuccessful reproductive attempts (foundress failed to produce both a mature male and female) were most common in mites from sealed larvae (22\%) and prepupae (61\%). Lack of any progeny was most common for mites from white-eyed (83\%) and pink-eyed pupae (92\%). We also collected foundress mites from sealed larvae and transferred them to cells containing newly sealed larvae, prepupae, white-eyed pupae, or pink-eyed pupae. Successful reproduction only occurred in the transfers to sealed larvae (26\%). Unsuccessful reproductive attempts were most common in transfers to newly sealed larvae (40\%) and to prepupae (25\%). Unsuccessful attempts involved the production of immature progeny (60\%), the production of only mature daughters (26\%) or the production of only a mature male (14\%). Generally, lack of progeny was not associated with mites having a lack of stored sperm. Our results suggest that mites exposed to the removal of prepupae or older brood due to hygiene are unlikely to produce viable mites if they invade new hosts soon after brood removal. Asynchrony between the reproductive status of reinvading mites and the developmental stage of their reinvasion hosts may be a primary cause of {NR} mites in hygienic colonies. Even if reinvading mites use hosts having the proper age for infestation, only a minority of them will reproduce.},

To quantify the {ABPV} burden a S {YBR} Green® based real time {PCR} protocol was developed. An {ABPV-specific} primer pair hybridising to the {RNA-dependent} {RNA-polymerase} region was used.

Fifty-six percent of all colonies monitored during the 10-month period died. The relative risk {(RR)} that a colony would die over the short term (∼50 days) was appreciably increased in colonies diagnosed with Idiopathic Brood Disease Syndrome {(IBDS)}, a condition where brood of different ages appear molten on the bottom of cells {(RR} = 3.2), or with a “queen event” (e.g., evidence of queen replacement or failure; {RR} = 3.1). We also found that several risk factors—including the incidence of a poor brood pattern, chalkbood {(CB)}, deformed wing virus {(DWV)}, sacbrood virus {(SBV)}, and exceeding the threshold of 5 Varroa mites per 100 bees—were differentially expressed in different beekeeping operations. Further, we found that a diagnosis of several factors were significantly more or less likely to be associated with a simultaneous diagnosis of another risk factor. These finding support the growing consensus that the causes of colony mortality are multiple and interrelated.},

Data were derived from tests carried out in field tests, comparing two configurations of a pneumatic precision drill: conventional drill; drill with air deflectors. In addition, static tests simulating the sowing under controlled conditions, were performed on the drill equipped with an innovative system developed at {CRA-ING.} During the field tests, the concentrations in the air of the active ingredients of four insecticides used in maize seed dressing (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam and fipronil) were recorded. The concentrations of active ingredients in the air were used for assessing the quantities of active ingredients that a bee might intercept as it flies in a sort of virtual tunnel, the dimensions of which were dependent upon the bee body cross-section and the length of flight. The results of the field tests show that the air deflectors were not completely effective in reducing the amount of active ingredients dispersed in the air. The results of the static tests with drill equipped with the prototype indicated reductions of the active ingredient air concentrations ranging from 72 \% up to 95 \%, with reference to the conventional drill. Such ratios were applied to the amounts of active ingredients intercepted by the bees in the virtual tunnel contributing to a consistent reduction of the probability that sub-lethal effects can occur.},

	abstract = {Chronic paralysis is an infectious and contagious disease of the honeybee {(Apis} mellifera L.) and is caused by the chronic bee paralysis virus {(CBPV).} This disease leads to death in adult bees and is therefore a serious threat for colony health. {CBPV} is a positive single-stranded {RNA} virus and its genome is composed of two {RNA} segments, {RNA} 1 and {RNA} 2, 3674 nt and 2305 nt, respectively. Although {CBPV} shares some characteristics with viruses classified into families Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae, it has not been assigned to any viral taxa yet. The characterisation of {CBPV} proteins and their functions are needed to better understand the mechanisms of {CBPV} infection. However, since honeybee cell lines are not yet available, experimental infection of adult bees is the only method currently available to propagate the virus. With the objective of studying {CBPV} proteins using the viral genome, we used experimental infection in adult bees to evaluate the infectivity of naked {CBPV} {RNAs} by direct inoculation. Our results demonstrated that an injection of naked {RNAs}, ranging from 109 to 1010 {CBPV} copies, caused chronic paralysis. Bees inoculated with naked {RNA} showed chronic paralysis signs 5 days after inoculation. Moreover, injected {RNAs} replicated and generated viral particles. We therefore provide an in vivo experimental model that will be useful tool for further studies by using a reverse genetics system.},

	abstract = {Animals living in social communities typically harbor a characteristic gut microbiota important for nutrition and pathogen defense. Accordingly, in the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, a distinctive microbial community, composed of a taxonomically restricted set of species specific to social bees, has been identified. Despite the ecological and economical importance of honey bees and the increasing concern about population declines, the role of their gut symbionts for colony health and nutrition is unknown. Here, we sequenced the metagenome of the gut microbiota of honey bees. Unexpectedly, we found a remarkable degree of genetic diversity within the few bacterial species colonizing the bee gut. Comparative analysis of gene contents suggests that different species harbor distinct functional capabilities linked to host interaction, biofilm formation, and carbohydrate breakdown. Whereas the former two functions could be critical for pathogen defense and immunity, the latter one might assist nutrient utilization. In a γ-proteobacterial species, we identified genes encoding pectin-degrading enzymes likely involved in the breakdown of pollen walls. Experimental investigation showed that this activity is restricted to a subset of strains of this species providing evidence for niche specialization. Long-standing association of these gut symbionts with their hosts, favored by the eusocial lifestyle of honey bees, might have promoted the genetic and functional diversification of these bee-specific bacteria. Besides revealing insights into mutualistic functions governed by the microbiota of this important pollinator, our findings indicate that the honey bee can serve as a model for understanding more complex gut-associated microbial communities.},

Only one pure N. ceranae infection was found, with the rest 284 infected samples assayed being pure N. apis infections. In 2009 and 2011, beekeepers or bee inspectors providing N. ceranae mixed positive bee samples in 2007 were again asked to submit samples (2009, n = 96; 2011, n = 83). No trend of an increased proportion of N. ceranae-infected samples could be found. The proportion of N. ceranae {DNA} in samples with mixed infection did not increase between 2007 and 2011.

The current study monitored the presence of N. apis and N. ceranae in honeybee frass and bottom scraps collected from six hives located in Deschambault, Quebec, Canada, from 2009 to 2010. Infection rates of N. ceranae and N. apis were quantified using duplex {qPCR} enabling the simultaneous detection of single and co-infections of the two species. Screening of all sample types revealed a greater presence of N. ceranae . {qPCR} infection levels for both Nosema species in bees and bottom scraps were correlated and showed a significant correlation ( P \&lt; 0.001) between infection rates of N. apis , while no significant correlative relationship ( P = 0.1037) was observed between those of N. ceranae . This study has demonstrated that Nosema spp. can be detected and reliably quantified in bottom scraps and frass of bee hives using {qPCR} diagnostic assays, and additionally, these techniques are not detrimental to the hive health, faster, and as reliable as sampling bees from within the colony when combined with {qPCR} diagnostic tests.},

Sets of paired genotypes that are presumably susceptible and resistant to the varroa mite were compared at the colony level for number of mites falling on sticky papers and for proportion of damaged mites. They were also compared at the individual level for intensity of grooming and mite removal success. Bees from the “resistant” colonies had lower mite population rates (up to 15 fold) and higher percentages of damaged mites (up to 9 fold) than bees from the “susceptible” genotypes. At the individual level, bees from the “resistant” genotypes performed significantly more instances of intense grooming (up to 4 fold), and a significantly higher number of mites were dislodged from the bees’ bodies by intense grooming than by light grooming (up to 7 fold) in all genotypes. The odds of mite removal were high and significant for all “resistant” genotypes when compared with the “susceptible” genotypes. The results of this study strongly suggest that grooming behavior and the intensity with which bees perform it, is an important component in the resistance of some honey bee genotypes to the growth of varroa mite populations. The implications of these results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Three isolates of each of the entomopathogenic fungi, Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana and Clonostachys rosea, were assessed for their pathogenicity to the honey bee parasitic mite, Varroa destructor. The fungi were applied to varroa mites by immersing them in a spore solution, and then the inoculated mites were placed on honey bee brood inside capped cells. At 7 days post inoculation (dpi), the three fungi caused significant varroa mortality compared to non-inoculated mites. In brood treated only with varroa mites, expression of the honey bee genes, hymenoptaecin and poly U binding factor 68 Kd {(pUf68)}, decreased over time, while expression of blue cheese {(BlCh)} and single minded {(SiMd)} was not affected. In brood inoculated directly only with M. anisopliae or B. bassiana, the emerged adults showed reduced weight indicating infection by the fungi, which was confirmed by observation of hyphae in the brood. Fungal infection of the brood resulted in increased expression of hymenoptaecin, {pUf68} and {BlCh}, but not {SiMd.} In brood treated with varroa mites that had been inoculated with the fungi, expression of hymenoptaecin, {pUf68} and {BlCh}, but not {SiMd}, was even more up-regulated. While varroa mites can suppress gene expression in honey bee brood, varroa mites infected with entomopathogenic fungi induced their expression. This may be due to a low level of fungal infection of the bee, which negated the immuno-suppression by the mites. Therefore, entomopathogenic fungi could reduce varroa mite damage to honey bee brood by both infecting the parasite and preventing varroa-associated suppression of honey bee immunity.},

	abstract = {Vitellogenin is a female-specific glucolipoprotein yolk precursor produced by all oviparous animals. Vitellogenin expression is under hormonal control, and the protein is generally synthesized directly before yolk deposition. In the honeybee {(Apis} mellifera), vitellogenin is not only synthesized by the reproductive queen, but also by the functionally sterile workers. In summer, the worker population consists of a hive bee group performing a multitude of tasks including nursing inside the nest, and a forager group specialized in collecting nectar, pollen, water, and propolis. Vitellogenin is synthesized in large quantities by hive bees. When hive bees develop into foragers, their juvenile hormone titers increase, and this causes cessation of their vitellogenin production. This inverse relationship between vitellogenin synthesis and juvenile hormone is opposite to the norm in insects, and the underlying proximate processes and life-history reasons are still not understood. Here we document an alternative use of vitellogenin by showing that it is a source for the proteinaceous royal jelly that is produced by the hive bees. Hive bees use the jelly to feed larvae, queen, workers, and drones. This finding suggests that the evolution of a brood-rearing worker class and a specialized forager class in an advanced eusocial insect society has been directed by an alternative utilization of yolk protein.},
